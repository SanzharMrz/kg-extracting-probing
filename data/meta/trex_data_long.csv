"The Province of L'Aquila (Provincia dell'Aquila) is the largest, most mountainous and least densely populated province of the Abruzzo region of Southern Italy. It comprises about half the landmass of Abruzzo and occupies the western part of the region. It has borders with the provinces of Teramo to the north, Pescara and Chieti to the east, Isernia (in Molise region) to the south and Frosinone, Rome and Rieti (in Lazio region) to the west. Its capital is the city of L'Aquila. The Province of L'Aquila includes the highest mountains of the Apennines (Gran Sasso, Maiella and Velino-Sirente), their highest peak, Corno Grande, the high plain of Campo Imperatore, and Europe's southernmost glacier, the Calderone. The province's major rivers are the Aterno-Pescara, Sangro, Liri, Salto, and the Turano; its major lakes are Lago Scanno and Lago Barrea. It once included the largest lake on the Italian peninsula, Lago Fucino, which was drained in one of the 19th century's largest engineering projects. The lake basin is today a flourishing agricultural area and an important technological district.","[('Teramo', 'Pescara', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Teramo', 'Rieti', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Teramo', 'It', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Pescara', 'Teramo', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Pescara', 'Chieti', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Pescara', 'It', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Chieti', 'Pescara', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Chieti', 'Isernia', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Chieti', 'It', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Isernia', 'Chieti', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Isernia', 'Frosinone', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Isernia', 'It', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Molise', 'Lazio', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Frosinone', 'Isernia', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Frosinone', 'It', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Rieti', 'Teramo', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Rieti', 'It', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Lazio', 'Molise', 'borders', 'P47'), ('It', 'Teramo', 'borders', 'P47'), ('It', 'Pescara', 'borders', 'P47'), ('It', 'Chieti', 'borders', 'P47'), ('It', 'Isernia', 'borders', 'P47'), ('It', 'Frosinone', 'borders', 'P47'), ('It', 'Rieti', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Apennines', 'Corno Grande', 'highest peak', 'P610')]","[""The Province of L'Aquila (Provincia dell'Aquila) is the largest, most mountainous and least densely populated province of the Abruzzo region of Southern Italy."", 'It comprises about half the landmass of Abruzzo and occupies the western part of the region.', 'It has borders with the provinces of Teramo to the north, Pescara and Chieti to the east, Isernia (in Molise region) to the south and Frosinone, Rome and Rieti (in Lazio region) to the west.', ""Its capital is the city of L'Aquila."", ""The Province of L'Aquila includes the highest mountains of the Apennines (Gran Sasso, Maiella and Velino-Sirente), their highest peak, Corno Grande, the high plain of Campo Imperatore, and Europe's southernmost glacier, the Calderone."", ""The province's major rivers are the Aterno-Pescara, Sangro, Liri, Salto, and the Turano; its major lakes are Lago Scanno and Lago Barrea."", ""It once included the largest lake on the Italian peninsula, Lago Fucino, which was drained in one of the 19th century's largest engineering projects."", 'The lake basin is today a flourishing agricultural area and an important technological district.']",8,234,35
"Gaius Asinius Gallus Saloninus was an ambitious Roman Senator with family connections to the Julio-Claudian house. Asinius Gallus was consul in 8 BC, and proconsul of Asia in 6 BC/5 BC. He was a friend of Emperor Augustus and opposed Emperor Tiberius. He introduced measures to the senate to increase Tiberius's power to try to shame the ruler. These embarrassed Tiberius publicly, and Tiberius had him arrested in 30. Tiberius alleged that Asinius had committed adultery with Agrippina the Elder, the opponent of Sejanus whom Tiberius had banished in 29, and had his name erased from all public monuments. Gaius died in 33 of starvation after three years in custody. He was the son of Gaius Asinius Pollio, a Roman Senator and consul 40 BC. In 11 BC he married Vipsania Agrippina, daughter of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and his first wife Caecilia Attica, and the former wife of Tiberius. They had the following children: A descendant of Vipsania and Gallus, Pomponia Graecina, became a distinguished lady. Pomponia might have been a Christian and lived an unhappy long life. Pomponia married Aulus Plautius. Plautius was a general in the conquest of Britain, which he received as a military ovation. Nero murdered their son, reportedly because Agrippina the Younger, mother of Nero, was in love with him and encouraged him to bid for the throne. Another descendant or otherwise relative, Gaius Asinius Lepidus Praetextatus (210 – after 242), became a Consul in 242, being the son of Gaius Asinius Lepidus, Suffect Consul of Rome in 222 and wife (Vettia) (b. 190 or 195). Asinius Gallus never denied his paternity of the son of Tiberius and Vipsania, Julius Caesar Drusus, heir from 19 AD to 23 AD, which means that he might also have been the father of the child Vipsania was expecting on her divorce. After his wife Vipsania died, he courted the widow of Germanicus, Agrippina. This, and his sharp wit, combined with the fact that he had been married to Vipsania, earned Tiberius' enmity. In 30 AD, at Tiberius' instigation, the Senate declared Gallus a public enemy, and he was held in conditions of solitary confinement (Cassius Dio 58.3): ""He had no companion or servant with him, spoke to no one, and saw no one, except when he was compelled to take food. And the food was of such quality and amount as neither to afford him any satisfaction or strength nor yet to allow him to die."" He died in prison in 33 (others mistakenly say 30) of starvation (Tacitus, Annals 6.23). When Agrippina died in October of that same year, Tiberius accused her of ""having had Asinius Gallus as a paramour and being driven by his death to loathe existence"" (Annals 6.25). His name was erased from public monuments (a practice known as damnatio memoriae), though they were restored after Tiberius' death.","[('Asinius Pollio', 'He', 'son', 'P40'), ('Vipsania Agrippina', 'Tiberius', 'wife', 'P26'), ('Vipsania Agrippina', 'Tiberius', 'wife', 'P26'), ('Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa', 'Vipsania Agrippina', 'daughter', 'P40'), ('Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa', 'Caecilia Attica', 'wife', 'P26'), ('Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa', 'Caecilia Attica', 'wife', 'P26'), ('Caecilia Attica', 'Vipsania Agrippina', 'daughter', 'P40'), ('Caecilia Attica', 'Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa', 'wife', 'P26'), ('Caecilia Attica', 'Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa', 'wife', 'P26'), ('Tiberius', 'Vipsania Agrippina', 'wife', 'P26'), ('Tiberius', 'Vipsania Agrippina', 'wife', 'P26'), ('Nero', 'Agrippina', 'mother', 'P25'), ('Agrippina', 'Nero', 'son', 'P40'), ('Agrippina', 'Nero', 'son', 'P40'), ('Nero', 'Agrippina', 'mother', 'P25'), ('Tiberius', 'Julius Caesar Drusus', 'son', 'P40'), ('Vipsania', 'Julius Caesar Drusus', 'son', 'P40'), ('Julius Caesar Drusus', 'Tiberius', 'father', 'P22'), ('Vipsania', 'Julius Caesar Drusus', 'son', 'P40'), ('Vipsania', 'Tiberius', 'married to', 'P26'), ('Tiberius', 'Vipsania', 'married to', 'P26')]","['Gaius Asinius Gallus Saloninus was an ambitious Roman Senator with family connections to the Julio-Claudian house.', 'Asinius Gallus was consul in 8 BC, and proconsul of Asia in 6 BC/5 BC.', 'He was a friend of Emperor Augustus and opposed Emperor Tiberius.', ""He introduced measures to the senate to increase Tiberius's power to try to shame the ruler."", 'These embarrassed Tiberius publicly, and Tiberius had him arrested in 30.', 'Tiberius alleged that Asinius had committed adultery with Agrippina the Elder, the opponent of Sejanus whom Tiberius had banished in 29, and had his name erased from all public monuments.', 'Gaius died in 33 of starvation after three years in custody.', 'He was the son of Gaius Asinius Pollio, a Roman Senator and consul 40 BC.', 'In 11 BC he married Vipsania Agrippina, daughter of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and his first wife Caecilia Attica, and the former wife of Tiberius.', 'They had the following children: A descendant of Vipsania and Gallus, Pomponia Graecina, became a distinguished lady.', 'Pomponia might have been a Christian and lived an unhappy long life.', 'Pomponia married Aulus Plautius.', 'Plautius was a general in the conquest of Britain, which he received as a military ovation.', 'Nero murdered their son, reportedly because Agrippina the Younger, mother of Nero, was in love with him and encouraged him to bid for the throne.', 'Another descendant or otherwise relative, Gaius Asinius Lepidus Praetextatus (210 – after 242), became a Consul in 242, being the son of Gaius Asinius Lepidus, Suffect Consul of Rome in 222 and wife (Vettia) (b.', '190 or 195).', 'Asinius Gallus never denied his paternity of the son of Tiberius and Vipsania, Julius Caesar Drusus, heir from 19 AD to 23 AD, which means that he might also have been the father of the child Vipsania was expecting on her divorce.', 'After his wife Vipsania died, he courted the widow of Germanicus, Agrippina.', ""This, and his sharp wit, combined with the fact that he had been married to Vipsania, earned Tiberius' enmity."", 'In 30 AD, at Tiberius\' instigation, the Senate declared Gallus a public enemy, and he was held in conditions of solitary confinement (Cassius Dio 58.3): ""He had no companion or servant with him, spoke to no one, and saw no one, except when he was compelled to take food.', 'And the food was of such quality and amount as neither to afford him any satisfaction or strength nor yet to allow him to die.""', 'He died in prison in 33 (others mistakenly say 30) of starvation (Tacitus, Annals 6.23).', 'When Agrippina died in October of that same year, Tiberius accused her of ""having had Asinius Gallus as a paramour and being driven by his death to loathe existence"" (Annals 6.25).', ""His name was erased from public monuments (a practice known as damnatio memoriae), though they were restored after Tiberius' death.""]",24,270,49
"The Unruochings (French: Unrochides; German: Unruochinger) were a Frankish noble family who established themselves in Italy. The family is named for the first member to come to prominence, Unruoch II of Friuli (floruit early 9th century).

The March of Friuli was considerably larger than modern Friuli, covering much of the modern Veneto and as far west as the Province of Brescia in Lombardy. The family's main landholdings, however, were in modern France, north of the River Seine, and southern Belgium. The family monastery, the centre of their power, was at Cysoing, near Tournai.

"The Serbian Cyrillic alphabet (Serbian: српска ћирилица/srpska ćirilica, pronounced [sr̩̂pskaː t͡ɕirǐlit͡sa]) is an adaptation of the Cyrillic script for the Serbian language, developed in 1818 by Serbian linguist Vuk Karadžić. It is one of the two alphabets used to write standard modern Serbian, Bosnian and Montenegrin, the other being Latin. Karadžić based his alphabet on the previous ""Slavonic-Serbian"" script, following the principle of ""write as you speak and read as it is written"", removing obsolete letters and letters representing iotified vowels, introducing ⟨J⟩ from Latin alphabet instead, and adding several consonant letters for sounds specific to Serbian phonology. During the same period, Croatian linguists led by Ljudevit Gaj adapted the Latin alphabet, in use in western South Slavic areas, using the same principles. As a result of this joint effort, Cyrillic and Latin alphabets for Serbo-Croatian have a complete one-to-one congruence, with the Latin digraphs Lj, Nj, and Dž counting as single letters. Vuk's Cyrillic alphabet was officially adopted in Serbia in 1868, and was in exclusive use in the country up to the inter-war period. Both alphabets were co-official in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and later in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Due to the shared cultural area, Gaj's Latin alphabet saw a gradual adoption in Serbia since, and both scripts are used to write modern standard Serbian, Bosnian and Montenegrin; Croatian has used only the Latin alphabet. In Serbia, Cyrillic is seen as being more traditional, and has the official status (designated in the Constitution as the ""official script"", compared to Latin's status of ""script in official use"" designated by a lower-level act). It is also an official script in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, along with Latin.

The most important one is Pianezze, which has an important textile factory, called Carlo Barbera, where luxury clothes sold all over the world are made. Callabiana is also known for its dam where many people from all the district of Biella go fishing and relaxing.

"Shahbag (also Shahbaugh, Bengali: শাহবাগ় Shabagh, [ˈʃaːbaːɣ]) is a major neighbourhood and a police precinct or thana in Dhaka, the capital and largest city of Bangladesh. It is also a major public transport hub. It is a junction between two contrasting sections of the city—Old Dhaka and New Dhaka—which lie, respectively, to its north and south. Developed in the 17th century during Mughal rule in Bengal, when Old Dhaka was the provincial capital and a centre of the flourishing muslin industry, the neighborhood was originally named Bagh-e-Badshahi (Persian for Garden of Kings), but later came to be called by the shortened name Shah (Persian:شاه, king) Bagh (Persian: باغ, garden). In the mid-19th century, the Shahbag area was developed as New Dhaka became a provincial centre of the British Raj, ending a century of decline brought on by the passing of Mughal rule. Shahbag is the location of the nation's leading educational and public institutions, including the University of Dhaka, the oldest and largest public university in Bangladesh, Dhaka Medical College,the largest medical college in the country, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), and the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, the largest public university for technological studies in the country. Shahbag hosts many street markets and bazaars. Since Bangladesh achieved independence in 1971, the Shahbag area has become a venue for celebrating major festivals, such as the Bengali New Year and Basanta Utsab (Holi). Shahbag's numerous ponds, palaces and gardens have inspired the work of writers, singers, and poets. With Dhaka University at its centre, the thana has been the origin of major political movements in the nation's 20th century history, including the All India Muslim Education Conference in 1905, which led to the All India Muslim League. In 1947, to both the partition of India and the creation of Pakistan; the Bengali Language Movement in 1952, which led to the recognition of Bengali as an official language of Pakistan; and the Six point movement in 1966, which led to the nation's independence. It was here, on 7 March 1971, that Sheikh Mujibur Rahman delivered a historic speech calling for the independence of Bangladesh from Pakistan, and here too, later that year, that the Pakistani Army surrendered in the Liberation War of Bangladesh. The area has since become a staging ground for protests by students and other groups. It was the site of public protests by around 30,000 civilians on 8 February 2013, against a lenient ruling against war criminals.","[('Shahbag', 'Dhaka', 'city', 'P131'), ('Bangladesh', 'Dhaka', 'capital', 'P36'), ('It', 'Dhaka', 'city', 'P131'), ('Shahbag', 'Bangladesh', 'country', 'P17'), ('Shahbag', 'Bangladesh', 'country', 'P17'), ('Shahbag', 'Bangladesh', 'nation', 'P17'), ('Shahbag', 'Bangladesh', 'country', 'P17'), ('Shahbag', 'Bangladesh', 'country', 'P17'), ('Shahbag', 'Bangladesh', 'nation', 'P17'), ('Dhaka', 'Bangladesh', 'country', 'P17'), ('Dhaka', 'Bangladesh', 'country', 'P17'), ('Dhaka', 'Bangladesh', 'nation', 'P17'), ('Dhaka', 'Bangladesh', 'country', 'P17'), ('Dhaka', 'Bangladesh', 'country', 'P17'), ('Dhaka', 'Bangladesh', 'nation', 'P17'), ('Dhaka Medical College', 'Bangladesh', 'country', 'P17'), ('Dhaka Medical College', 'Bangladesh', 'country', 'P17'), ('Dhaka Medical College', 'Bangladesh', 'nation', 'P17'), ('Dhaka Medical College', 'Bangladesh', 'country', 'P17'), ('Dhaka Medical College', 'Bangladesh', 'country', 'P17'), ('Dhaka Medical College', 'Bangladesh', 'nation', 'P17'), ('Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University', 'Bangladesh', 'country', 'P17'), ('Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University', 'Bangladesh', 'country', 'P17'), ('Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University', 'Bangladesh', 'nation', 'P17'), ('Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University', 'Bangladesh', 'country', 'P17'), ('Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University', 'Bangladesh', 'country', 'P17'), ('Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University', 'Bangladesh', 'nation', 'P17'), ('BSMMU', 'Bangladesh', 'country', 'P17'), ('BSMMU', 'Bangladesh', 'country', 'P17'), ('BSMMU', 'Bangladesh', 'nation', 'P17'), ('BSMMU', 'Bangladesh', 'country', 'P17'), ('BSMMU', 'Bangladesh', 'country', 'P17'), ('BSMMU', 'Bangladesh', 'nation', 'P17')]","['Shahbag (also Shahbaugh, Bengali: শাহবাগ় Shabagh, [ˈʃaːbaːɣ]) is a major neighbourhood and a police precinct or thana in Dhaka, the capital and largest city of Bangladesh.', 'It is also a major public transport hub.', 'It is a junction between two contrasting sections of the city—Old Dhaka and New Dhaka—which lie, respectively, to its north and south.', 'Developed in the 17th century during Mughal rule in Bengal, when Old Dhaka was the provincial capital and a centre of the flourishing muslin industry, the neighborhood was originally named Bagh-e-Badshahi (Persian for Garden of Kings), but later came to be called by the shortened name Shah (Persian:شاه, king) Bagh (Persian: باغ, garden).', 'In the mid-19th century, the Shahbag area was developed as New Dhaka became a provincial centre of the British Raj, ending a century of decline brought on by the passing of Mughal rule.', ""Shahbag is the location of the nation's leading educational and public institutions, including the University of Dhaka, the oldest and largest public university in Bangladesh, Dhaka Medical College,the largest medical college in the country, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), and the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, the largest public university for technological studies in the country."", 'Shahbag hosts many street markets and bazaars.', 'Since Bangladesh achieved independence in 1971, the Shahbag area has become a venue for celebrating major festivals, such as the Bengali New Year and Basanta Utsab (Holi).', ""Shahbag's numerous ponds, palaces and gardens have inspired the work of writers, singers, and poets."", ""With Dhaka University at its centre, the thana has been the origin of major political movements in the nation's 20th century history, including the All India Muslim Education Conference in 1905, which led to the All India Muslim League."", ""In 1947, to both the partition of India and the creation of Pakistan; the Bengali Language Movement in 1952, which led to the recognition of Bengali as an official language of Pakistan; and the Six point movement in 1966, which led to the nation's independence."", 'It was here, on 7 March 1971, that Sheikh Mujibur Rahman delivered a historic speech calling for the independence of Bangladesh from Pakistan, and here too, later that year, that the Pakistani Army surrendered in the Liberation War of Bangladesh.', 'The area has since become a staging ground for protests by students and other groups.', 'It was the site of public protests by around 30,000 civilians on 8 February 2013, against a lenient ruling against war criminals.']",14,427,58
"The Great Eastern Trail project began as an attempt to create a second long hiking route through the Appalachians west of the Appalachian Trail in the eastern United States. Several other names were suggested and used earlier, including the Western Appalachian Alternative. From south to north, it runs from the Florida-Georgia border through Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania, ending in western New York state. More recently, it was redefined as a potential connector in the US National Trails System, linking the Florida National Scenic Trail in the south to the North Country National Scenic Trail in New York. In between, it would connect with and briefly overlap two other National Scenic Trails: the Appalachian and the Potomac Heritage Trails. The project enjoyed support from the American Hiking Society and the Rivers, Trails, and Conservation Assistance Program of the US National Park Service but then became an independent entity. The Great Eastern Trail Association was incorporated in Virginia on August 10, 2007 by signatories from the nine states through which the trail passes. Many sections of Great Eastern Trail are already hikeable for day use and backpackers. The longest continuously usable sections are on the Pinhoti National Recreation Trail, and from the Allegheny Trail at I-64 exit 1, just east of the VA/WV border, northward through portions of Virginia, West Virginia, all of Maryland, all of Pennsylvania, to a junction with Finger Lakes Trail carrying North Country National Scenic Trail near South Bradford, New York.

"South Sudan (/ˌsaʊθ suˈdɑːn, -ˈdæn/), officially the Republic of South Sudan, is a landlocked country in northeastern Africa that gained its independence from Sudan in 2011. Its current capital is Juba, which is also its largest city. It is planned that the capital city will be changed to the more centrally located Ramciel in the future. South Sudan is bordered by Sudan to the north, Ethiopia to the east, Kenya to the southeast, Uganda to the south, the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the southwest, and the Central African Republic to the west. It includes the vast swamp region of the Sudd, formed by the White Nile and known locally as the Bahr al Jabal. The territories of modern South Sudan and the Republic of the Sudan were occupied by Egypt under the Muhammad Ali Dynasty, and later governed as an Anglo-Egyptian condominium until Sudanese independence was achieved in 1956. Following the First Sudanese Civil War, the Southern Sudan Autonomous Region was formed in 1972 and lasted until 1983. A second Sudanese civil war soon developed and ended with the Comprehensive Peace Agreement of 2005. Later that year, southern autonomy was restored when an Autonomous Government of Southern Sudan was formed. South Sudan became an independent state on 9 July 2011, following a referendum that passed with 98.83% of the vote. It is a United Nations member state, a member state of the African Union, of the East African Community, and of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development.

"The art of motion-picture making within the Kingdom of Spain or by Spanish filmmakers abroad is collectively known as Spanish Cinema. In recent years, Spanish cinema has achieved high marks of recognition. In the long history of Spanish cinema, the great filmmaker Luis Buñuel was the first to achieve universal recognition, followed by Pedro Almodóvar in the 1980s. Spanish cinema has also seen international success over the years with films by directors like Segundo de Chomón, Florián Rey, Luis García Berlanga, Juan Antonio Bardem, Carlos Saura, Julio Médem and Alejandro Amenábar. Woody Allen, upon receiving the prestigious Prince of Asturias Award in 2002 in Oviedo remarked: ""when I left New York, the most exciting film in the city at the time was Spanish, Pedro Almodóvar's one. I hope that Europeans will continue to lead the way in film making because at the moment not much is coming from the United States."" Non-directors have obtained less international notability like the cinematographer Néstor Almendros, the Art director Gil Parrondo, the screenwriter Rafael Azcona, the actresses Maribel Verdú and, especially, Penélope Cruz and the actors Fernando Rey, Francisco Rabal, Antonio Banderas, Javier Bardem and Fernando Fernán Gómez have obtained significant recognition outside Spain. Today, 10 to 20% of box office receipts in Spain are generated by domestic films, a situation that repeats itself in many nations of Europe and the Americas. The Spanish government has therefore implemented various measures aimed at supporting local film production and movie theaters, which include the assurance of funding from the main national television stations. The trend is being reversed with the recent screening of productions such as the €30 million film Alatriste (starring Viggo Mortensen), the Academy Award winning Spanish film Pan's Labyrinth (starring Maribel Verdú), Volver (starring Penélope Cruz and Carmen Maura), and Los Borgia (starring Paz Vega), all of them sold-out blockbusters in Spain. Another aspect of Spanish cinema mostly unknown to the general public is the appearance of English-language Spanish films such as Agora (directed by Alejandro Amenábar and starring Rachel Weisz), Ché (directed by Steven Soderbergh and starring Benicio del Toro), The Machinist (starring Christian Bale), The Others (starring Nicole Kidman), and Miloš Forman’s Goya's Ghosts (starring Javier Bardem and Natalie Portman), The Impossible (starring Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts).

"Raúl Alfonso Sáenz Meraz (1910-1982) is a Mexican business man, known in the north of Mexico in the decades of 30's and 40's specially in the states of Chihuahua and Durango, for having been the first owner of a Coca-Cola bottling plant in Mexico, in the city of Nuevo Casas Grandes, in Chihuahua state, bringing a source of income to an area of Mexico that was undergoing economical withdrawal. He was a very active entrepreneur of his time, acquiring magnesium mines scattered in Sierra Tarahumara, which provided more than 5,000 men with a job, in a time where it was very scarce. The wages paid in his mines were higher than most other places, earning himself a good reputation for being humane in a time where the rich weren't concerned about the lower classes. He also brought the first TV antenna to Chihuahua state, transmitting only stations from USA, since it was closer to the border than to the existing Mexican TV stations of the time, which were in Mexico City. Raúl Saenz married Maria Eustolia Nevarez, a young girl from a positioned family, and together they gave birth to 11 children, from which the three first were Armando, Rodolfo and Javier. They had only two daughters, Teresa and Maria del Socorro. The Saenz Nevarez family was known for having the first gadgets and commodities of the time in northern Mexico, such as a TV, a washing machine, an electric iron, or a fridge. People from all social levels were welcomed inside their house to take a look at the new technology brought to town by Mr Saenz.They earned the care of the peasants and bourgoise alike, and soon their last name became a signature of wealth and prosperity. Raúl Saenz's offspring were all studying in Jesuit boarding schools, which back then was a kind of education only accessible to the rich, and it was believed to be the best. Raul then was at the peak of his success, he had amounted a large fortune, so he felt it safe to sell some his business to put weight off his shoulders. Among those business, he sold the bottling plant, and half of the mines. Little did he know it was going to be his downfall. Business started to become weaker and weaker ín the 60's and by the early 80's most of his wealth was in the hands of one of his sons, who was then appointed his father's fortune overseer. His name is still remembered all over Chihuahua, specially among the descendants of those of wealthy families in the 50's.

"A Franco-Polish alliance was formed in 1524 between the king of France Francis I and the king of Poland Sigismund I. Francis I was looking for allies in Central Europe to create a balance against the power of Habsburg Emperor Charles V. Queen Bona Sforza, the Italian wife of Sigismund, was instrumental in promoting the alliance, with the objective of recovering sovereignty of Milan. Sigismund himself was motivated by such an alliance because Charles V was getting closer to Russia, thus threatening Poland on two fronts. The negotiations were handled by Antonio Rincon in 1524, who was then followed by Jerome Laski. Through the agreement, the son of Francis, Henry, Duke of Orléans, was to marry a daughter of Sigismund I, and Sigismund's eldest son was to marry a daughter of Francis I. According to the same agreement, Sigismund was supposed to support Francis' efforts at reconquering Milan to which Sigismund had some right through his earlier marriage with Bona Sforza. The alliance was effectively signed in 1524. The agreement fell through, however, when Francis I was vanquished by Charles V at the Battle of Pavia in 1525. When Francis again looked for Central European allies after 1526, he would look at Hungary instead and finally formed a Franco-Hungarian alliance with King Zapolya in 1528.","[('Sigismund', 'Queen Bona', 'wife', 'P26'), ('Sigismund', 'Bona Sforza', 'wife', 'P26'), ('Queen Bona', 'Sigismund', 'wife', 'P26'), ('Queen Bona', 'Sigismund', 'wife', 'P26'), ('Bona Sforza', 'Sigismund', 'wife', 'P26'), ('Bona Sforza', 'Sigismund', 'wife', 'P26'), ('Sigismund', 'Queen Bona', 'wife', 'P26'), ('Sigismund', 'Bona Sforza', 'wife', 'P26'), ('Sigismund', 'Bona Sforza', 'marry', 'P26'), ('Sigismund', 'Bona Sforza', 'marry', 'P26'), ('Sigismund', 'Bona Sforza', 'marry', 'P26'), ('Sigismund', 'Bona Sforza', 'marry', 'P26'), ('Sigismund', 'Bona Sforza', 'marry', 'P26'), ('Sigismund', 'Bona Sforza', 'marry', 'P26'), ('Sigismund', 'Bona Sforza', 'marry', 'P26'), ('Sigismund', 'Bona Sforza', 'marry', 'P26'), ('Bona Sforza', 'Sigismund', 'marry', 'P26'), ('Bona Sforza', 'Sigismund', 'marry', 'P26'), ('Bona Sforza', 'Sigismund', 'marry', 'P26'), ('Bona Sforza', 'Sigismund', 'marry', 'P26'), ('Bona Sforza', 'Sigismund', 'marry', 'P26'), ('Bona Sforza', 'Sigismund', 'marry', 'P26'), ('Bona Sforza', 'Sigismund', 'marry', 'P26'), ('Bona Sforza', 'Sigismund', 'marry', 'P26')]","['A Franco-Polish alliance was formed in 1524 between the king of France Francis I and the king of Poland Sigismund I.

"Coffee production in India is dominated in the hill tracts of South Indian states, with the state of Karnataka accounting 53% followed by Kerala 28% and Tamil Nadu 11% of production of 8,200 tonnes. Indian coffee is said to be the finest coffee grown in the shade rather than direct sunlight anywhere in the world.

"Argentina (/ˌɑːrdʒənˈtiːnə/; [aɾxenˈtina]), officially the Argentine Republic (Spanish: República Argentina), is a federal republic located in southeastern South America. Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with its neighbour Chile, it is bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north; Brazil to the northeast; Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east; Chile to the west and the Drake Passage to the south. With a mainland area of 2,780,400 km2 (1,073,500 sq mi), Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world, the second-largest in Latin America, and the largest Spanish-speaking one.Argentina claims sovereignty over part of Antarctica, the Falkland Islands (Spanish: Islas Malvinas), South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. The country is subdivided into twenty-three provinces (Spanish: provincias, singular provincia) and one autonomous city (ciudad autónoma), Buenos Aires, which is the federal capital of the nation (Spanish: Capital Federal) as decided by Congress.The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions, but exist under a federal system. The earliest recorded human presence in the area of modern-day Argentina dates back to the Paleolithic period. The country has its roots in Spanish colonization of the region during the 16th century. Argentina rose as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in 1776. The declaration and fight for independence (1810–1818) was followed by an extended civil war that lasted until 1861, culminating in the country's reorganization as a federation of provinces with Buenos Aires as its capital city. The country thereafter enjoyed relative peace and stability, with massive waves of European immigration radically reshaping its cultural and demographic outlook. The almost-unparalleled increase in prosperity led to Argentina becoming the seventh wealthiest developed nation in the world by the early 20th century. After 1930 Argentina descended into political instability and periodic economic crisis that pushed it back into underdevelopment, though it nevertheless remained among the fifteen richest countries until the mid-20th century. Argentina retains its historic status as a middle power in international affairs, and is a prominent regional power in the Southern Cone and Latin America. Argentina has the second largest economy in South America, the third-largest in Latin America and is a member of the G-15 and G-20 major economies. It is also a founding member of the United Nations, World Bank, World Trade Organization, Mercosur, Union of South American Nations, Community of Latin American and Caribbean States and the Organization of Ibero-American States. It is the country with the highest Human Development Index in Latin America with a rating of ""very high"".

Today the Finnish-speaking majority stands for ca 60% and the Swedish-speaking minority for about 39% of the population. On June 26, 2006, the Sipoo town council decided on a strategy to triple the municipality's population over the next 25 years. The decision was made after Helsinki announced plans to annex a part of the municipality in order to continue to build high-end urbanizations in the coastline (and thus high-tax revenue producing). The Finnish Council of State voted in favour of the annexation on June 28, 2007, with votes 8 to 4. Sipoo disputed this and appealed the Supreme Administrative Court but the court upheld the decision of the Council of State and the annexation took place on January 1, 2009.

"Saudi Arabia (/ˌsɔːdiː əˈreɪbiə/, /ˌsaʊ-/), officially known as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), is an Arab state in Western Asia constituting the bulk of the Arabian Peninsula. With a land area of approximately 2,150,000 km2 (830,000 sq mi), Saudi Arabia is geographically the fifth-largest state in Asia and second-largest state in the Arab world (after Algeria). Saudi Arabia is bordered by Jordan and Iraq to the north, Kuwait to the northeast, Qatar, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates to the east, Oman to the southeast, and Yemen to the south. It is the only nation with both a Red Sea coast and a Persian Gulf coast, and most of its terrain consists of arid inhospitable desert or barren landforms. The area of modern-day Saudi Arabia formerly consisted of four distinct regions: Hejaz, Najd, and parts of Eastern Arabia (Al-Ahsa) and Southern Arabia ('Asir). The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was founded in 1932 by Ibn Saud. He united the four regions into a single state through a series of conquests beginning in 1902 with the capture of Riyadh, the ancestral home of his family, the House of Saud. The country has since been an absolute monarchy, effectively a hereditary dictatorship governed along Islamic lines. The ultra-conservative Wahhabism religious movement within Sunni Islam has been called ""the predominant feature of Saudi culture"", with its global spreading largely financed by the oil and gas trade. Saudi Arabia is sometimes called ""the Land of the Two Holy Mosques"" in reference to Al-Masjid al-Haram (in Mecca), and Al-Masjid an-Nabawi (in Medina), the two holiest places in Islam. The Kingdom has a total population of 28.7 million, of which 20 million are Saudi nationals and 8 million are foreigners. Petroleum was discovered in 1938 and followed up by several other finds in the Shia-majority Eastern Province. Saudi Arabia has since become the world's largest oil producer and exporter, controlling the world's second largest oil reserves, and the sixth largest gas reserves. The kingdom is categorized as a World Bank high-income economy with a high Human Development Index, and is the only Arab country to be part of the G-20 major economies. However, the economy of Saudi Arabia is the least diversified in the Gulf Cooperation Council, lacking any significant service or production sector (apart from the extraction of resources). It is a monarchical autocracy and is ranked as ""Not Free"" by Freedom House. Saudi Arabia has the fourth highest military expenditure in the world, and in 2010–14, SIPRI found that Saudi Arabia was the world's second largest arms importer. Saudi Arabia is considered a regional and middle power. In addition to the GCC, it is an active member of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and OPEC. Limitations on women's rights in Saudi Arabia make it the only country where women are not permitted to drive. The country is also criticised for its capital punishment, which is condemned internationally because of the wide range of crimes which can result in the death penalty. It is usually carried out by public beheading and sometimes crucifixion. It applies even to individuals who were under the age of 18 at the time of their alleged crimes, which is a violation of international law.","[('Arabian Peninsula', 'Saudi Arabia', 'state', 'P17'), ('Arabian Peninsula', 'Saudi Arabia', 'state', 'P17'), ('Arabian Peninsula', 'KSA', 'state', 'P17'), ('Saudi Arabia', 'Jordan', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Saudi Arabia', 'Kuwait', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Saudi Arabia', 'Qatar', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Saudi Arabia', 'Bahrain', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Saudi Arabia', 'United Arab Emirates', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Saudi Arabia', 'Oman', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Saudi Arabia', 'Yemen', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Jordan', 'Saudi Arabia', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Kuwait', 'Saudi Arabia', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Qatar', 'Saudi Arabia', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Bahrain', 'Saudi Arabia', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('United Arab Emirates', 'Saudi Arabia', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('United Arab Emirates', 'Oman', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Oman', 'Saudi Arabia', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Oman', 'United Arab Emirates', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Oman', 'Yemen', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Yemen', 'Saudi Arabia', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Yemen', 'Oman', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Riyadh', 'He', 'state', 'P17')]","['Saudi Arabia (/ˌsɔːdiː əˈreɪbiə/, /ˌsaʊ-/), officially known as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), is an Arab state in Western Asia constituting the bulk of the Arabian Peninsula.', 'With a land area of approximately 2,150,000 km2 (830,000 sq mi), Saudi Arabia is geographically the fifth-largest state in Asia and second-largest state in the Arab world (after Algeria).', 'Saudi Arabia is bordered by Jordan and Iraq to the north, Kuwait to the northeast, Qatar, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates to the east, Oman to the southeast, and Yemen to the south.', 'It is the only nation with both a Red Sea coast and a Persian Gulf coast, and most of its terrain consists of arid inhospitable desert or barren landforms.', ""The area of modern-day Saudi Arabia formerly consisted of four distinct regions: Hejaz, Najd, and parts of Eastern Arabia (Al-Ahsa) and Southern Arabia ('Asir)."", 'The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was founded in 1932 by Ibn Saud.', 'He united the four regions into a single state through a series of conquests beginning in 1902 with the capture of Riyadh, the ancestral home of his family, the House of Saud.', 'The country has since been an absolute monarchy, effectively a hereditary dictatorship governed along Islamic lines.', 'The ultra-conservative Wahhabism religious movement within Sunni Islam has been called ""the predominant feature of Saudi culture"", with its global spreading largely financed by the oil and gas trade.', 'Saudi Arabia is sometimes called ""the Land of the Two Holy Mosques"" in reference to Al-Masjid al-Haram (in Mecca), and Al-Masjid an-Nabawi (in Medina), the two holiest places in Islam.', 'The Kingdom has a total population of 28.7 million, of which 20 million are Saudi nationals and 8 million are foreigners.', 'Petroleum was discovered in 1938 and followed up by several other finds in the Shia-majority Eastern Province.', ""Saudi Arabia has since become the world's largest oil producer and exporter, controlling the world's second largest oil reserves, and the sixth largest gas reserves."", 'The kingdom is categorized as a World Bank high-income economy with a high Human Development Index, and is the only Arab country to be part of the G-20 major economies.', 'However, the economy of Saudi Arabia is the least diversified in the Gulf Cooperation Council, lacking any significant service or production sector (apart from the extraction of resources).', 'It is a monarchical autocracy and is ranked as ""Not Free"" by Freedom House.', ""Saudi Arabia has the fourth highest military expenditure in the world, and in 2010–14, SIPRI found that Saudi Arabia was the world's second largest arms importer."", 'Saudi Arabia is considered a regional and middle power.', 'In addition to the GCC, it is an active member of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and OPEC.', ""Limitations on women's rights in Saudi Arabia make it the only country where women are not permitted to drive."", 'The country is also criticised for its capital punishment, which is condemned internationally because of the wide range of crimes which can result in the death penalty.', 'It is usually carried out by public beheading and sometimes crucifixion.', 'It applies even to individuals who were under the age of 18 at the time of their alleged crimes, which is a violation of international law.']",23,199,34
"Morgan le Fay /ˈmɔːrɡən lə ˈfeɪ/, alternatively known as Morgan le Faye, Morgen, Morgaine, Morgain, Morgana, Morganna, Morgant, Morgane, Morgne, Morge, Morgue, and other names, is a powerful enchantress in the Arthurian legend. Early works featuring Morgan do not elaborate her character beyond her role as a fay or sorceress. She became both more prominent and morally ambivalent in later texts, in particular in cyclical prose works such as the Lancelot-Grail and the Post-Vulgate Cycle, in which she turns into a dangerous arch-enemy of King Arthur and an antagonist of some tales. The earliest accounts of Geoffrey of Monmouth in Vita Merlini and Gerald of Wales refer to Morgan in conjunction with the Isle of Apples (Avalon) to which the fatally wounded Arthur was carried off after the Battle of Camlann. To the former, she was a healer and an enchantress, the eldest of nine sisters. In early chivalric romances by Chrétien de Troyes, she also figures as a healer. Her character may be partially derived from that of the Welsh goddess Modron and other myths. In later medieval stories, depictions of Morgan change dramatically. She is often said to be the daughter of Arthur's mother Lady Igraine and her first husband Gorlois, so that Arthur, the son of Igraine and Uther Pendragon, is her half-brother. She becomes an apprentice of Merlin and a vindictive adversary of Arthur and the knights of the Round Table, with a special hatred for his wife Queen Guinevere. In Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur and elsewhere, she is unhappily married to King Urien, with whom she has the son Ywain, and her sisters include Morgause. She is also wanton and sexually aggressive, with many lovers including Merlin and Accolon, and an unrequited love for Lancelot. Morgan is an indirect instrument of Arthur's death, though she eventually reconciles with him and retains her original role, serving as one of the sorcerous queens who take him on his final journey to Avalon.","[('Arthur', 'Igraine', 'mother', 'P25'), ('Arthur', 'Igraine', 'mother', 'P25'), ('Igraine', 'Arthur', 'daughter', 'P40'), ('Igraine', 'Arthur', 'son', 'P40'), ('Igraine', 'Gorlois', 'husband', 'P26'), ('Igraine', 'Arthur', 'daughter', 'P40'), ('Igraine', 'Arthur', 'son', 'P40'), ('Igraine', 'Uther Pendragon', 'husband', 'P26'), ('Gorlois', 'Igraine', 'husband', 'P26'), ('Gorlois', 'Igraine', 'husband', 'P26'), ('Arthur', 'Igraine', 'mother', 'P25'), ('Arthur', 'Igraine', 'mother', 'P25'), ('Igraine', 'Arthur', 'daughter', 'P40'), ('Igraine', 'Arthur', 'son', 'P40'), ('Igraine', 'Gorlois', 'husband', 'P26'), ('Igraine', 'Arthur', 'daughter', 'P40'), ('Igraine', 'Arthur', 'son', 'P40'), ('Igraine', 'Uther Pendragon', 'husband', 'P26'), ('Uther Pendragon', 'Arthur', 'daughter', 'P40'), ('Uther Pendragon', 'Arthur', 'son', 'P40'), ('Uther Pendragon', 'Igraine', 'husband', 'P26'), ('Uther Pendragon', 'Arthur', 'daughter', 'P40'), ('Uther Pendragon', 'Arthur', 'son', 'P40'), ('Uther Pendragon', 'Igraine', 'husband', 'P26'), ('Arthur', 'Queen Guinevere', 'wife', 'P26'), ('Queen Guinevere', 'Arthur', 'wife', 'P26')]","['Morgan le Fay /ˈmɔːrɡən lə ˈfeɪ/, alternatively known as Morgan le Faye, Morgen, Morgaine, Morgain, Morgana, Morganna, Morgant, Morgane, Morgne, Morge, Morgue, and other names, is a powerful enchantress in the Arthurian legend.', 'Early works featuring Morgan do not elaborate her character beyond her role as a fay or sorceress.', 'She became both more prominent and morally ambivalent in later texts, in particular in cyclical prose works such as the Lancelot-Grail and the Post-Vulgate Cycle, in which she turns into a dangerous arch-enemy of King Arthur and an antagonist of some tales.', 'The earliest accounts of Geoffrey of Monmouth in Vita Merlini and Gerald of Wales refer to Morgan in conjunction with the Isle of Apples (Avalon) to which the fatally wounded Arthur was carried off after the Battle of Camlann.', 'To the former, she was a healer and an enchantress, the eldest of nine sisters.', 'In early chivalric romances by Chrétien de Troyes, she also figures as a healer.', 'Her character may be partially derived from that of the Welsh goddess Modron and other myths.', 'In later medieval stories, depictions of Morgan change dramatically.', ""She is often said to be the daughter of Arthur's mother Lady Igraine and her first husband Gorlois, so that Arthur, the son of Igraine and Uther Pendragon, is her half-brother."", 'She becomes an apprentice of Merlin and a vindictive adversary of Arthur and the knights of the Round Table, with a special hatred for his wife Queen Guinevere.', ""In Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur and elsewhere, she is unhappily married to King Urien, with whom she has the son Ywain, and her sisters include Morgause."", 'She is also wanton and sexually aggressive, with many lovers including Merlin and Accolon, and an unrequited love for Lancelot.', ""Morgan is an indirect instrument of Arthur's death, though she eventually reconciles with him and retains her original role, serving as one of the sorcerous queens who take him on his final journey to Avalon.""]",13,257,42

"Quebec, Canada's largest province, occupies a vast territory (nearly three times the size of France), most of which is very sparsely populated. More than 90 percent of Quebec's area lies within the Canadian Shield, and includes the greater part of the Labrador Peninsula. Quebec's highest mountain is Mont D'Iberville, which is located on the border with Newfoundland and Labrador in the northeastern part of the province in the Torngat Mountains. The addition of parts of the vast and scarcely populated District of Ungava of the Northwest Territories between 1898 and 1912 gave the province its current form. Quebec is bordered by the province of Ontario, James Bay and Hudson Bay (including the circular Nastapoka arc) to the west, the provinces of New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador to the east, the United States (Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and New York) to the south, and Hudson Strait and Ungava Bay to the north. Its northernmost point is Cape Wolstenholme. In 1927, the border between the Province of Quebec and the Dominion of Newfoundland was delineated by the British Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The government of Quebec does not officially recognize this boundary. See The Labrador boundary dispute. The territory of Quebec is extremely rich in resources in its coniferous forests, lakes, and rivers—pulp and paper, lumber, and hydroelectricity are still some of the province's most important industries. The far north of the province, Nunavik, is subarctic or arctic and is mostly inhabited by Inuit. The most populous region is the Saint Lawrence River valley in the south, where the capital, Quebec City, and the largest city, Montreal, are situated. North of Montreal are the Laurentians, a range of ancient mountains, and to the east are the Appalachian Mountains which extends into the Eastern Townships and Gaspésie regions.

Throughout its 72-year history, the republic's borders changed many times, with a significant portion of what is now Western Ukraine being annexed by Soviet forces in 1939 from the Republic of Poland, and the addition of Russian Crimea in 1954. From the start, the eastern city of Kharkiv served as the republic's capital. However, in 1934, the seat of government was subsequently moved to the city of Kiev, which remained the capital of newly independent Ukraine. Geographically, the Ukrainian SSR was situated in Eastern Europe to the north of the Black Sea, bordered by the Soviet republics of Moldova, Belarus, and Russia. The Ukrainian SSR's border with Czechoslovakia formed the Soviet Union's western-most border point.

My expectations of the industry were pretty grandiose at that stage: I was a kid with stars in my eyes. Bill took me aside one night and, like a kind, loving father, said I had to remember to be grateful and that I had to remember every day that I was lucky to be in this business and working.

Conventionally, descent is patrilineal. However, in 1632 when an Ottoman court challenged a man wearing a sayyid's green turban he established that he was a sayyid on his mother's side, and this was accepted by the court.:130 Daughters of sayyids are given the titles Sayyida, Alawiyah, or Sharifa. In some regions of the Islamic world, e.g., India, the descendants of Muhammad are given the title Amir or Mir, meaning ""commander"", ""general"", or ""prince"". Children of Sayyida mother but a non Sayyid father are referred to as Mirza. In the Arab world, it is the equivalent of the English word ""liege lord"" or ""master"" when referring to a descendant of Muhammad, as in Sayyid Ali Sultan. This is the reason the word sidi (from the contracted form sayyidī, 'my liege') is used in the Arabic. In the early period, the Arabs used the term Sayyid and Sharif to denote descendants from both Hasan and Husayn. However, in the modern era, the term 'Sharif' (for female it is called Sharifah ) has been used to denote descendants from Hasan and the term 'Sayyid' (for female it is called Sayyidah) has been used to denote descendants from Husayn.

"The Uruguay River (Spanish: Río Uruguay, [uɾuˈɣwai]; Portuguese: Rio Uruguai, [uɾuˈɡwaj]) is a river in South America. It flows from north to south and forms parts of the boundaries of Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay, separating some of the Argentine provinces of La Mesopotamia from the other two countries. It passes between the states of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil; forms the eastern border of the provinces of Misiones, Corrientes, and Entre Ríos in Argentina; and makes up the western borders of the departments of Artigas, Salto, Paysandú, Río Negro, Soriano, and Colonia in Uruguay. The river measures about 1,838 kilometres (1,142 mi) in length and starts in the Serra do Mar in Brazil, where the Canoas River and the Pelotas River are joined, at about 200 metres (660 ft) above mean sea level. In this stage the river goes through uneven, broken terrain, forming rapids and falls. Its course through Rio Grande do Sul is not navigable. An unusual feature of the Uruguay River is a submerged canyon. This canyon formed during the Ice Age, when the climate was drier and the river was narrower. Its depth is up to 100 metres (330 ft) below the bottom of the river channel and it is 1/8 to 1/3 as wide as the river. The canyon is only visible in two places, one of which is the Moconá Falls (also called the Yucumã Falls). However, the falls are not visible for 150 days per year and become more like rapids when they are not visible. Unlike most waterfalls, the Moconá Falls are parallel to the river, not perpendicular.

Together with the Paraná River, the Uruguay forms the Río de la Plata estuary. It is navigable from around Salto Chico. Its main tributary is the Río Negro, which is born in the south of Brazil and goes through Uruguay for 500 km until its confluence with the Uruguay River, which is located 100 km north of the Uruguay's confluence with the Río de la Plata, in Punta Gorda, Colonia Department, Uruguay. The river is crossed by five international bridges called (from north to south): Integration Bridge and Paso de los Libres-Uruguaiana International Bridge, between Argentina and Brazil; and the Salto Grande Bridge, General Artigas Bridge and Libertador General San Martín Bridge between Argentina and Uruguay. The drainage basin of the Uruguay River has an area of 365,000 square kilometres (141,000 sq mi).

"Valenzuela (/vɒlənzjuːˈɛlɑː/; [ˌbɐlenzuˈwelɐ]), officially known as the City of Valenzuela (Filipino: Lungsod ng Valenzuela) (ISO: PH-00; PSGC: 137504000) or simply Valenzuela City, is the 119th largest city of the Philippines and one of the 16 cities plus a municipality that compose the region of Metro Manila, located about 14 km (7.9 miles) north of Manila. Valenzuela is categorized by virtue of Republic Act Nos. 7160 and 8526 as a highly urbanized, first-class city based on income classification and number of population. A chartered city located on the island of Luzon, it is bordered by Meycauayan (Bulacan) in the north, Quezon City and northern Caloocan to the east; by Obando (Bulacan) to the west; by Malabon, southern Caloocan and Tullahan River to the south. With a land mass of 47.02 km2 and a population of 575,356 in August 2010, Valenzuela is the 13th most populous city in the Philippines. Valenzuela's population is composed of 72% Tagalog people followed by 5% Bicolanos. Small percentage of foreign nationals reside in the city. Valenzuela was named after Pío Valenzuela, a doctor and a member of Katipunan. The town preceding Valenzuela that was originally called Polo was formed in 1621 due to religious separation movements from parishes of Meycauayan (Catanghalan). Polo has been occupied twice by foreign armies other than colonial powers Spain and United States: first during the Seven Years' War by the British and by the Japanese during the Second World War. Owing to the cross migration of people across the country and its location as the northernmost point of Metro Manila, Valenzuela has developed into a multicultural metropolis. A former agricultural rural area, Valenzuela has grown into a major economic and industrial center of the Philippines when a large number of industries relocated to the central parts of the city.","[('Valenzuela', 'Metro Manila', 'city', 'P131'), ('Valenzuela', 'Manila', 'city', 'P131'), ('Valenzuela', 'Metro Manila', 'city', 'P131'), ('Valenzuela', 'Manila', 'city', 'P131'), ('Valenzuela', 'Metro Manila', 'city', 'P131'), ('Valenzuela', 'Manila', 'city', 'P131'), ('Valenzuela City', 'Metro Manila', 'city', 'P131'), ('Valenzuela City', 'Manila', 'city', 'P131'), ('Metro Manila', 'PH', 'city', 'P131'), ('Metro Manila', 'Philippines', 'city', 'P131'), ('Manila', 'PH', 'city', 'P131'), ('Manila', 'Philippines', 'city', 'P131'), ('Meycauayan', 'Bulacan', 'city', 'P131'), ('Meycauayan', 'Caloocan', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Meycauayan', 'Obando', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Meycauayan', 'Bulacan', 'city', 'P131'), ('Meycauayan', 'Caloocan', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Quezon City', 'Caloocan', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Quezon City', 'Caloocan', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Caloocan', 'Meycauayan', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Caloocan', 'Quezon City', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Caloocan', 'Malabon', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Obando', 'Meycauayan', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Obando', 'Bulacan', 'city', 'P131'), ('Obando', 'Bulacan', 'city', 'P131'), ('Malabon', 'Caloocan', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Malabon', 'Obando', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Malabon', 'Caloocan', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Caloocan', 'Meycauayan', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Caloocan', 'Quezon City', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Caloocan', 'Malabon', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Valenzuela', 'Philippines', 'land', 'P17')]","['Valenzuela (/vɒlənzjuːˈɛlɑː/; [ˌbɐlenzuˈwelɐ]), officially known as the City of Valenzuela (Filipino: Lungsod ng Valenzuela) (ISO: PH-00; PSGC: 137504000) or simply Valenzuela City, is the 119th largest city of the Philippines and one of the 16 cities plus a municipality that compose the region of Metro Manila, located about 14 km (7.9 miles) north of Manila.', 'Valenzuela is categorized by virtue of Republic Act Nos.', '7160 and 8526 as a highly urbanized, first-class city based on income classification and number of population.', 'A chartered city located on the island of Luzon, it is bordered by Meycauayan (Bulacan) in the north, Quezon City and northern Caloocan to the east; by Obando (Bulacan) to the west; by Malabon, southern Caloocan and Tullahan River to the south.', 'With a land mass of 47.02 km2 and a population of 575,356 in August 2010, Valenzuela is the 13th most populous city in the Philippines.', ""Valenzuela's population is composed of 72% Tagalog people followed by 5% Bicolanos."", 'Small percentage of foreign nationals reside in the city.', 'Valenzuela was named after Pío Valenzuela, a doctor and a member of Katipunan.', 'The town preceding Valenzuela that was originally called Polo was formed in 1621 due to religious separation movements from parishes of Meycauayan (Catanghalan).', ""Polo has been occupied twice by foreign armies other than colonial powers Spain and United States: first during the Seven Years' War by the British and by the Japanese during the Second World War."", 'Owing to the cross migration of people across the country and its location as the northernmost point of Metro Manila, Valenzuela has developed into a multicultural metropolis.', 'A former agricultural rural area, Valenzuela has grown into a major economic and industrial center of the Philippines when a large number of industries relocated to the central parts of the city.']",12,361,55

"Prior to the Civil War, the ""pelican in her piety"" surrounded by the motto ""Justice, Union and Confidence"" was commonly used as the state's seal, after the Civil War, Union supplanted Justice as the ideal to uphold and the motto was changed to ""Union, Justice and Confidence"" The Great Seal of the State of Louisiana was adopted as the official state seal of Louisiana in 1902. The seal consists of a heraldic charge called a ""pelican in her piety,"" representing a brown pelican (the official state bird) wounding her breast to feed her young from her own blood. This symbol, emblematic of Christian charity, is also found on the Louisiana state flag. The Louisiana state motto of ""Union, justice, confidence"" surrounds the birds on the state seal. An outer ring further identifies it with the words ""State of Louisiana"". During the 19th century it was traditional in Louisiana flags and the state seal for the ""pelican in her piety"" to have three drops of blood on her chest. However, in later years the tradition (on both the state flag and seal) had been haphazardly followed, which was noticed by an eighth-grader at Vandebilt Catholic High School in Houma who brought this to the attention of his state legislator. The issue was resolved in April 2006, when the Louisiana State Legislature passed a bill (House Bill 833/Act 92) which requires three drops of blood to be depicted on the pelican used in both the state's flag and seal.","[('Civil War', 'Union', 'state', 'P17'), ('Civil War', 'Union', 'state', 'P17'), ('Civil War', 'Union', 'state', 'P17'), ('Civil War', 'Union', 'state', 'P17'), ('Civil War', 'Union', 'state', 'P17'), ('Civil War', 'Union', 'state', 'P17'), ('Civil War', 'Union', 'state', 'P17'), ('Civil War', 'Union', 'state', 'P17'), ('Civil War', 'Union', 'state', 'P17'), ('Civil War', 'Union', 'state', 'P17'), ('Civil War', 'Union', 'state', 'P17'), ('Civil War', 'Union', 'state', 'P17'), ('Louisiana', 'Union', 'state', 'P17'), ('Louisiana', 'Union', 'state', 'P17'), ('Louisiana', 'Union', 'state', 'P17'), ('Louisiana', 'Union', 'state', 'P17'), ('Louisiana', 'Union', 'state', 'P17'), ('Louisiana', 'Union', 'state', 'P17'), ('Louisiana', 'Union', 'state', 'P17'), ('Louisiana', 'Union', 'state', 'P17'), ('Louisiana', 'Union', 'state', 'P17'), ('Louisiana', 'Union', 'state', 'P17'), ('Louisiana', 'Union', 'state', 'P17'), ('Louisiana', 'Union', 'state', 'P17'), ('Louisiana', 'Union', 'state', 'P17'), ('Louisiana', 'Union', 'state', 'P17')]","['Prior to the Civil War, the ""pelican in her piety"" surrounded by the motto ""Justice, Union and Confidence"" was commonly used as the state\'s seal, after the Civil War, Union supplanted Justice as the ideal to uphold and the motto was changed to ""Union, Justice and Confidence"" The Great Seal of the State of Louisiana was adopted as the official state seal of Louisiana in 1902.', 'The seal consists of a heraldic charge called a ""pelican in her piety,"" representing a brown pelican (the official state bird) wounding her breast to feed her young from her own blood.', 'This symbol, emblematic of Christian charity, is also found on the Louisiana state flag.', 'The Louisiana state motto of ""Union, justice, confidence"" surrounds the birds on the state seal.', 'An outer ring further identifies it with the words ""State of Louisiana"".', 'During the 19th century it was traditional in Louisiana flags and the state seal for the ""pelican in her piety"" to have three drops of blood on her chest.', 'However, in later years the tradition (on both the state flag and seal) had been haphazardly followed, which was noticed by an eighth-grader at Vandebilt Catholic High School in Houma who brought this to the attention of his state legislator.', ""The issue was resolved in April 2006, when the Louisiana State Legislature passed a bill (House Bill 833/Act 92) which requires three drops of blood to be depicted on the pelican used in both the state's flag and seal.""]",8,377,66
"The border between the modern states of Switzerland and Italy extends to 744 km, from the French-Swiss-Italian tripoint at Mont Dolent in the west to the Austrian-Swiss-Italian tripoint near Piz Lad in the east. Much of the border runs across the High Alps, rising above 4,600 meters as it passes east of Dufourspitze, but it also descends to the lowest point in Switzerland as it passes Lago Maggiore below 200 meters. The border is a product of the Napoleonic period, established with the provisional constitution of the Helvetic Republic of 15 January 1798, restored in 1815.While this border existed as a border of Switzerland from 1815, there was only a unified Italian state to allow the existence of a ""Swiss-Italian border"" with the formation of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861, it previously comprised the borders between Switzerland and the Kingdom of Sardinia, the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia and the province of Cisleithania of Austria-Hungary. There remained some territorial disputes after the formation of the Kingodom of Italy, resolved in the Convenzione tra l'Italia e la Svizzera per l'accertamento della frontiera fra la Lombardia ed il Cantone dei Grigioni of 1863. Other Swiss-Italian treaties regarding the course of the border date to 1873/4, 1936/7 and 1941. Since 1946, it has remained unchanged as the border between the Italian Republic and the Swiss Confederacy, with the exception of minor corrections and exchanges of territory, such as the inclusion of the Lago di Lei barrage in Switzerland in the 1950s. The border separates the Swiss canton of Valais from the Italian Aosta Valley and Piedmont region, the canton of Ticino from Piedmont and Lombardy, and the canton of Grisons from Lombardy and South Tyrol.Running east from Mont Dolent, the border touches Grand Golliat and the Great St Bernard Pass and then visits a series of three-thousander peaks including Mont Velan, Mont Brulé and Tête Blanche before rising to 4171 m at Dent d'Herens and to 4,476 m at Matterhorn, followed by Furgghorn, Breithorn, Zwillinge, Monte Rosa at 4554 m, and Grenzgipfel just east of Dufourspitze at 4618 m. The border now encircles the Italian Domodossola valley, passing Gonda, Monte Leone, Bortelhorn, Helsenhorn, traversed by the Simplon Tunnel connecting Brig with Varzo, Grieshorn just south of Nufenen Pass, and forming the western border of Ticino runs across Marchhorn, Basodino, Pizzo Fiorera, Wandfluhhorn, Pizzo Quadro, Pizzo di Porcaresc, Pilone and descends below 1000 m running across Centovalli along a stretch of the Melezza. It rises again to Pilone peak before descending to Lago Maggiore between Brissago and Cannobio, on the left bank making landfall at Caviano and passing west of Lugano and the villages of Malcantone to Ponte Tresa at Lake Lugano. It then forms the southernmost corner of Switzerland including Chiasso, turning north again outside of Como and now forming the eastern border of Ticino running west of Lake Como, of passing Lake Lugano again west of Lugano and touching Monte Boglia, Cima di Fojorina, Gazzirola, Cima di Cugn, Pizzo Campanile, again reaching 3000 m at Pizzo Quadro between Val Mesolcina and Chiavenna, and further north to Pizzo Tambo, Splügen Pass and Piz Timun. The Swiss-Italia border here has the peculiarity of including the reservoir of Lago di Lei in Italy but in an artificial salient including the reservoir's dam in Switzerland. Turning south again it traverses Val Bregaglia at Castasegna and turns east towards Cima di Castello, now forming the northern border of the Valtellina, a territory that was lost by the Three Leagues in 1797 with the formation of the Cisalpine Republic. Val Poschiavo remains part of Grisons, and is separated from Valtellina by the border passing just north of Tirano, turning north again along Piz Paradisin, Munt Cotschen, Piz da l'Acqua to the inclusion of Livigno in Italy. The border now follows the southern watershed of Val Müstair, touching Piz Murtaröl, Piz Tea Fondada, Piz Schumbraida, Piz Umbrail until it reaches the pass road connecting Vinschgau with the Valtellina and Stilfserjoch. The border now turns north for a final stretch separating Val Müstair and the Engadin from Vinschgau, South Tyrol, terminating at the Austrian-Swiss-Italian tripoint just north of Piz Lad.","[('Switzerland', 'Italy', 'border', 'P47'), ('Italy', 'Switzerland', 'border', 'P47'), ('Switzerland', 'Lago Maggiore', 'lowest point', 'P1589'), ('Austria-Hungary', 'Switzerland', 'border',

"William Frank Isbell (August 21, 1875 – July 15, 1941) was a Major League first baseman, second baseman, and outfielder in the 1910s. He played for the Chicago Cubs in 1898, briefly, with 37 hits in 159 at bats (.233 batting average), and pitched as well as playing the outfield. Thirteen of his seventeen games pitched came with the Cubs. After not being seen in baseball for the next year, Isbell showed up again in 1900 playing for the Chicago White Sox as a full-time first baseman. The American League was not recognized in the Majors until 1901. Isbell played with the Sox until 1909. He batted left-handed and threw right-handed. Born in Delevan, New York, Isbell was nicknamed Bald Eagle due to his receding hairline, something he was quite sensitive about. Isbell was a good enough hitter to earn a starting spot on some very good White Sox teams, including the pennant-winning 1901 team, managed by Clark Griffith, the second-place 1905 team led by Fielder Jones, and finally the 1906 World Series champion White Sox team that included shortstop George Davis and pitchers Doc White and Ed Walsh. It was known as one of the worst-hitting teams to ever win the World Series, with only Davis and Isbell hitting above .260 (Davis hit .277, Isbell .279). Isbell set many offensive World Series records that year, including doubles and extra base hits in a game. However, he was better known for his outstanding speed, including his 1901 season when he had 52 stolen bases and led the Majors. He averaged 37 steals a year and ended with 253 for his career.

"Simon House (born 29 August 1948 in Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England) is a composer and classically trained violinist and keyboard player, perhaps best known for his work with space rock band Hawkwind. His arrival in 1974 introduced a new element to the band's style. He was the first conspicuously trained musician to join, and the sound that emerged on Hall of the Mountain Grill was a previously unheard, lush chaos which sounded a little like Black Sabbath meets The Moody Blues. Before Hawkwind, House played in High Tide and the Third Ear Band, who contributed the soundtrack to Roman Polanski's Macbeth. Guitarist Tony Hill recounted how House became a member of High Tide: ""[Pete Pavli and I were] hanging out with and crashing where we could at Mike's or Wayne's. Simon ended up crashing there as well. Simon was playing bass then. He said: 'I used to play violin, you know?' So I said 'Get it!' That was basically it."" He joined Hawkwind in 1974, playing on some of their albums, before leaving for David Bowie's band in 1978. That, along with Robert Calvert falling into clinical depression, led to Hawkwind breaking up in mid-tour. Along with other Hawkwind members he guested on science fiction author Michael Moorcock's New Worlds Fair in 1975 and has also played on solo projects by former Hawkwind members Robert Calvert and Nik Turner. Since the 1970s, as well as cutting an album (Interesting Times) with Tony Hill under the High Tide banner and releasing several solo albums under his own name, House has twice rejoined Hawkwind; between 1989 and 1991, and between 2001 and 2003.","[('Hawkwind', 'Michael Moorcock', 'members', 'P527'), ('Hawkwind', 'Michael Moorcock', 'members', 'P527'), ('Hawkwind', 'Michael Moorcock', 'members', 'P527'), ('Hawkwind', 'Michael Moorcock', 'members', 'P527'), ('Hawkwind', 'Robert Calvert', 'members', 'P527'), ('Hawkwind', 'Robert Calvert', 'members', 'P527'), ('Hawkwind', 'Robert Calvert', 'members', 'P527'), ('Hawkwind', 'Robert Calvert', 'members', 'P527'), ('Hawkwind', 'Nik Turner', 'members', 'P527'), ('Hawkwind', 'Nik Turner', 'members', 'P527'), ('Hawkwind', 'Nik Turner', 'members', 'P527'), ('Hawkwind', 'Nik Turner', 'members', 'P527'), ('Hawkwind', 'Michael Moorcock', 'members', 'P527'), ('Hawkwind', 'Michael Moorcock', 'members', 'P527'), ('Hawkwind', 'Michael Moorcock', 'members', 'P527'), ('Hawkwind', 'Michael Moorcock', 'members', 'P527'), ('Hawkwind', 'Robert Calvert', 'members', 'P527'), ('Hawkwind', 'Robert Calvert', 'members', 'P527'), ('Hawkwind', 'Robert Calvert', 'members', 'P527'), ('Hawkwind', 'Robert Calvert', 'members', 'P527'), ('Hawkwind', 'Nik Turner', 'members', 'P527'), ('Hawkwind', 'Nik Turner', 'members', 'P527'), ('Hawkwind', 'Nik Turner', 'members', 'P527'), ('Hawkwind', 'Nik Turner', 'members', 'P527')]","['Simon House (born 29 August 1948 in Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England) is a composer and classically trained violinist and keyboard player, perhaps best known for his work with space rock band Hawkwind.', ""His arrival in 1974 introduced a new element to the band's style."", 'He was the first conspicuously trained musician to join, and the sound that emerged on Hall of the Mountain Grill was a previously unheard, lush chaos which sounded a little like Black Sabbath meets The Moody Blues.', ""Before Hawkwind, House played in High Tide and the Third Ear Band, who contributed the soundtrack to Roman Polanski's Macbeth."", 'Guitarist Tony Hill recounted how House became a member of High Tide: ""[Pete Pavli and I were] hanging out with and crashing where we could at Mike\'s or Wayne\'s.', 'Simon ended up crashing there as well.', 'Simon was playing bass then.', ""He said: 'I used to play violin, you know?'"", ""So I said 'Get it!'"", 'That was basically it.""', ""He joined Hawkwind in 1974, playing on some of their albums, before leaving for David Bowie's band in 1978."", 'That, along with Robert Calvert falling into clinical depression, led to Hawkwind breaking up in mid-tour.', ""Along with other Hawkwind members he guested on science fiction author Michael Moorcock's New Worlds Fair in 1975 and has also played on solo projects by former Hawkwind members Robert Calvert and Nik Turner."", 'Since the 1970s, as well as cutting an album (Interesting Times) with Tony Hill under the High Tide banner and releasing several solo albums under his own name, House has twice rejoined Hawkwind; between 1989 and 1991, and between 2001 and 2003.']",14,245,42

"Thiruvithamcode also spelled Thiruvithancode, Thiruvithankodu and Thiruvithangodu) is a small panchayat town located in the Kanyakumari district of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.Kanyakumari district in Tamil Nadu was carved out of Travancore-Cohin State in the 1956 State re-organization comprising its four southern taluks of Thovala, Agastheeswaram, Kalkulam and Vilavancode.Nanjilnadu, which is the present Agasteeswaram and Thovalai taluks of the Kanyakumari district, was under the rule of Pandyas till the early 10th century and then under Cheras. Idainadu comprising the present Kalkulam and Vilavancode taluks were under the rule of Cheras. When the power of Cheras declined due to the rise of Hoysalas and western Chalukyas, the Venad (Travancore) Chieftains (descendants of the Cheras) took advantage of the situation and gradually established their hold, on many areas of Nanjilnadu. The annexation commenced by Veera Kerala Varma was to a large extent continued by his successors and completed by 1115 A.D. For about four centuries, Travancore was ruled by powerful kings who were consistently making incursions into the pandyan territories. As a result, the Vijayanagar kings proceeded against Travancore .In 1609 Kanyakumari fell in to the mighty hands of Viswanatha Nayak of Madurai. Consequent to this, there was no serious threat to Nanjilnadu, until 1634. In 1729, Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma took control of Travancore after putting down the insurgency of the Ettuveettil Pillamars. He defeated the forces of the Dutch East India Company under Eustachius De Lannoy in 1741 at the Battle of Colachel. In the later part of the 18th century, Chanda Sahib, a rebel commandant related to the Nawab of Arcot attacked Nagercoil and other areas. Travancore had to contend with such attacks and monetary demands from the Carnatic Nawabs or from their rebellious governors until the English fully supported the state of Travancore. In spite of the troubles encountered in the southern border of Travancore, Marthanda Varma expanded the kingdom towards north up to Aluva and established the state of Travancore. By this, the present day Kanyakumari District came to be known as Southern Travancore. Later, the capital was shifted from Padmanabhapuram (in present-day Kanyakumari District) to Thiruvananthapuram. After Marthanda varma, Venad had to face incursions of Mysore's Tipu Sultan. This led to treaties with the English East India Company. Subsequently, the kings of Travancore ruled the country accepting the hegemony of the English. In 1762, a treaty with the Carnatic Nawab brokered by the English gave control of Shengottai and Kanyakumari to Travancore. The rule of the Travancore royals finally ceased in 1947 when Travancore had to join the independent Indian Union. In 1949, Kanyakumari district became part of the newly constituted Travancore-Cochin State. The people of Agasteeswarem, Thovalai, Kalkulam and Vilavancode Taluks, which formed the southern divisions of the former Trivandrum District, were predominantly Tamil speaking and a popular agitation for merging the Tamil speaking majority areas of Southern Travancore to Madras State (now Tamil Nadu) was started during this period and was intensified under the leadership of M.A. Nesamony,a prominent leader from Nadar community who stoutly fought against the oppression of majority Nair community . They agitated for the merger of this area with Madras State. The States Reorganisation Commission also recommended merger. Accordingly, the States Reorganisation Act, 1956 was passed and the Kanyakumari District was formed on 1 November 1956, annexing the four Taluks of Southern Travancore namely Agasteeswarem, Thovalai, Kalkulam. Thereby Thiruvithamcode which formed part of Kalkulam Taluk in Southern Travancore became part of Kanyakumari District in Tamil Nadu from 1 November 1956 onwards. According to History of Travancore written by Shangunni Menon the word Thiruvithamcode means Thiru-prosperity,Vithan-abode,Code-Place.An abode of prosperity land. Thiruvithamcode is thickly populated by Muslim community. Historical treatises depicts that while Padmanabhapuram was the capital of Travancore Muslim business men from North India came to Padmanabhapuram and settled at Thiruvithamcode and Thengapattanam and married to local women. Gradually attracted by the universal brotherhood of Islam many natives embraced Islam. Even before the formation of Kerala State Muslim community from Thiruvithamcode settled in many parts of Travancore,Cochin and Malabar States including the present Thiruvananathapuram District in Kerala state. Muslim community from Thiruvithamcode settled in Thiruvananthapuram has an association called TMAT(Thiruvithamcode Muslim Association Thiruvananthapuram) which is a registered charitable Society having its registered office at Chalai. Thiruvithamcode is about 20 km from Nagercoil, and 2 km from Thuckalay. As of 2001 India census, Thiruvithankodu had a population of 16,689. Males constitute 49% of the population and females 51%. Thiruvithankodu has an average literacy rate of 82%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 84%, and female literacy is 79%.

"This is a list of the native wild mammal species recorded in Central America. Central America is usually defined as the southernmost extension of North America; however, from a biological standpoint it is useful to view it as a separate region of the Americas. Central America is distinct from the remainder of North America in being a tropical region, part of the Neotropic ecozone, whose flora and fauna display a strong South American influence. The rest of North America is mostly subtropical or temperate, belongs to the Nearctic ecozone, and has many fewer species of South American origin. At present Central America bridges North and South America, facilitating migrations in both directions, but this phenomenon is relatively recent from a geological perspective. The formation of this land bridge through volcanic activity three million years ago precipitated the Great American Interchange, an important biogeographical event. In part because of this history, Central America is extremely biodiverse; it comprises most of the Mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot. The mountains running down the spine of Central America have also contributed to biodiversity by creating montane habitats, including cloud forests and grasslands, and by separating species from the lowlands along the Pacific and Caribbean coasts. However, Central America's biodiversity suffered a blow in the Quaternary extinction event, which started around 12500 cal BP, at roughly the time of arrival of Paleoindians; much of the megafauna died out at this time. The effects of modern human activities on climate and ecosystem integrity pose a further threat to Central America's fauna. The list consists of those mammal species found from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec to the northwestern border of Colombia, a region including the Mexican states of Chiapas, Tabasco, Campeche, Yucatán and Quintana Roo, and the nations of Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama. As of May 2012, the list contains 378 species, 177 genera, 47 families and 13 orders. Of the taxa from nonflying, nonmarine groups (203 species, 91 genera, 31 families and 10 orders), those of South American origin (opossums, xenarthrans, monkeys and caviomorph rodents) comprise 21% of species, 34% of genera, 52% of families and 50% of orders. Thus, South America's contribution to Central America's biodiversity is fairly modest at the species level, but substantial at higher taxonomic levels. In comparison to South America, a famously biodiverse continent, Central America has 27% as many species, 51% as many genera, 81% as many families and 86% as many orders (considering noncetacean taxa only), while having only 4.3% of the land area. Of the species, 2 are extinct, 11 are critically endangered, 13 are endangered, 20 are vulnerable, 20 are near-threatened, 35 are data-deficient and 5 are not yet evaluated. Mammal species presumed extinct since AD 1500 (two cases) are included. Domestic species and introduced species are not listed. NOTE: this list is almost inevitably going to be incomplete, since new species are continually being recognized via discovery or reclassification. Places to check for missing species include the Wikipedia missing mammal species list, including recently removed entries, and the species listings in the articles for mammalian genera, especially those of small mammals such as rodents or bats.

"Cassandane (Ancient Greek: Κασσανδάνης Kassandanēs) was an Achaemenian Persian noblewoman and the ""dearly loved"" wife of Cyrus the Great. She was a daughter of Pharnaspes.

"The Treaty of Mersen or Meerssen, concluded on 8 August 870, was a treaty of partition of the realm of Lothair II by his uncles Louis the German of East Francia and Charles the Bald of West Francia, the two surviving sons of Emperor Louis I the Pious.The empire of Louis the Pious, son of Charlemagne, had originally split in three parts by the 843 Treaty of Verdun, whereas his eldest son Lothair I received the Imperial crown and the personal realm of Middle Francia, while: Louis († 876), the second born son, received East Francia (which would evolve into the Kingdom of Germany) Charles the Bald († 877), his half-brother, received West Francia (which would evolve into the Kingdom of France) Upon the death of Lothair I in 855, his realm of Middle Francia was partitioned between his sons by the Treaty of Prüm: Louis II († 875), the eldest son, received the imperial crown and Italy Charles († 863) became King of Provence (Lower Burgundy and Provence proper) Lothair II († 869) received Austrasia (the central part still controlled by his father after Verdun), Frisia and Upper Burgundy - this realm came to be named Lotharii Regnum (Lotharingia) Lothair II ceded the southeastern parts of Upper Burgundy to his brothers, whereas Charles of Provence received the bishoprics of Belley and Tarentaise in 859, and Louis II of Italy the bishoprics of Geneva, Lausanne and Sion a year later. Charles of Provence suffered from epilepsy and died heirless in 863, and his kingdom was partitioned between his brothers. Lothair II, his heir, received only the western Lower Burgundian parts (bishoprics of Lyon, Vienne, Vivarais and Uzès) which were bordering his western Upper Burgundy (remnants of his original Burgundian possessions), while Louis II received the whole rest of the Kingdom of Provence. Lothair II died in 869 without legitimate children so his heir was his brother, Emperor Louis II of Italy. As Louis was at that time campaigning against the Emirate of Bari, his uncles, Louis the German and Charles the Bald, took his inheritance. Charles had himself crowned in Metz the same year, but was forced by his brother to partition the short-lived Lotharingia, together with the lands Lothair II acquired after the death of Charles of Provence, as they had agreed at Metz in 868. Their contract of 870 at Meerssen replaced the 843 Treaty of Verdun, after which the Carolingian Empire was also split into three parts, by dividing the northern half of Middle Francia stretching from the Rhone valley to the North Sea, in effect recombining sundered territories of Francia into two larger east and west divisions. However, at this time large parts of the Frisian coast were under Viking control and therefore only divided on paper. The borderline ran roughly along the rivers Meuse, Ourthe, Moselle, Saone and Rhone. In the north, Louis received most of Lothair's Austrasia, with his eastern part including both Aachen and Metz, and most of Frisia. But in the south, while Louis received most of Upper Burgundy that was left to Lothair (after ceding the southern half to Italy), Charles received Lothair's inheritance in Lower Burgundy (including Lyon) and a small western part of Upper Burgundy (parts of Portois and Varais (including Besancon)) - this opened him the way to Italy. Louis joined the newly acquired parts of central Austrasia to the subkingdom of his son Louis the Younger in eastern Austrasia, while the illegitimate son of Lothair II, Hugh, was granted the Duchy of Alsace. The arrangement did not endure more than ten years. Upon the death of Louis the German in 876, Charles the Bald, by then King of Italy and Emperor, attacked eastern Lotharingia, but was rejected by Louis the Younger in the Battle of Andernach (876). In turn, after Charles the Bald had died and his successors struggled to consolidate their rule over West Francia, Louis the Younger campaigned in western Lotharingia in 879. Charles' grandsons were forced to cede the whole Lotharingia to him, sealed by the 880 Treaty of Ribemont, according to which it finally became part of East Francia.","[('Lothair II', 'Lothair I',

brothers.', 'Lothair II, his heir, received only the western Lower Burgundian parts (bishoprics of Lyon, Vienne, Vivarais and Uzès) which were bordering his western Upper Burgundy (remnants of his original Burgundian possessions), while Louis II received the whole rest of the Kingdom of Provence.', 'Lothair II died in 869 without legitimate children so his heir was his brother, Emperor Louis II of Italy.', 'As Louis was at that time campaigning against the Emirate of Bari, his uncles, Louis the German and Charles the Bald, took his inheritance.', 'Charles had himself crowned in Metz the same year, but was forced by his brother to partition the short-lived Lotharingia, together with the lands Lothair II acquired after the death of Charles of Provence, as they had agreed at Metz in 868.', 'Their contract of 870 at Meerssen replaced the 843 Treaty of Verdun, after which the Carolingian Empire was also split into three parts, by dividing the northern half of Middle Francia stretching from the Rhone valley to the North Sea, in effect recombining sundered territories of Francia into two larger east and west divisions.', 'However, at this time large parts of the Frisian coast were under Viking control and therefore only divided on paper.', 'The borderline ran roughly along the rivers Meuse, Ourthe, Moselle, Saone and Rhone.', ""In the north, Louis received most of Lothair's Austrasia, with his eastern part including both Aachen and Metz, and most of Frisia."", ""But in the south, while Louis received most of Upper Burgundy that was left to Lothair (after ceding the southern half to Italy), Charles received Lothair's inheritance in Lower Burgundy (including Lyon) and a small western part of Upper Burgundy (parts of Portois and Varais (including Besancon)) - this opened him the way to Italy."", 'Louis joined the newly acquired parts of central Austrasia to the subkingdom of his son Louis the Younger in eastern Austrasia, while the illegitimate son of Lothair II, Hugh, was granted the Duchy of Alsace.', 'The arrangement did not endure more than ten years.', 'Upon the death of Louis the German in 876, Charles the Bald, by then King of Italy and Emperor, attacked eastern Lotharingia, but was rejected by Louis the Younger in the Battle of Andernach (876).', 'In turn, after Charles the Bald had died and his successors struggled to consolidate their rule over West Francia, Louis the Younger campaigned in western Lotharingia in 879.', ""Charles' grandsons were forced to cede the whole Lotharingia to him, sealed by the 880 Treaty of Ribemont, according to which it finally became part of East Francia.""]",16,1394,240
"The Kingdom of England /ˈɪŋɡlənd/ was a sovereign state on the island of Great Britain from the 10th century—when it emerged from various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms—until 1707—when it was united with Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain. In the early 11th century the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, united by Æthelstan (r. 927–939), became part of the North Sea Empire of Cnut the Great, a personal union between England, Denmark and Norway. The Norman conquest of England in 1066 led to the transfer of the English capital city and chief royal residence from the Anglo-Saxon one at Winchester to Westminster, and the City of London quickly established itself as England's largest and principal commercial centre. Histories of the kingdom of England from the Norman conquest of 1066 conventionally distinguish periods named after successive ruling dynasties: Norman 1066–1154, Plantagenet 1154–1485, Tudor 1485–1603 and Stuart 1603–1714 (interrupted by the Interregnum of 1649–1660).Dynastically, all English monarchs after 1066 ultimately claim descent from the Normans; the distinction of the Plantagenets is merely conventional, beginning with Henry II (reigned 1154-1189) as from that time, the Angevin kings became ""more English in nature""; the houses of Lancaster and York are both Plantagenet cadet branches, the Tudor dynasty claimed descent from Edward III via John Beaufort and James VI and I of the House of Stuart claimed descent from Henry VII via Margaret Tudor. The completion of the conquest of Wales by Edward I in 1284 put Wales under the control of the English crown. Edward III (reigned 1327–1377) transformed the Kingdom of England into one of the most formidable military powers in Europe; his reign also saw vital developments in legislation and government—in particular the evolution of the English parliament. From the 1340s the kings of England also laid claim to the crown of France, but after the Hundred Years' War and the outbreak of the Wars of the Roses in 1455, the English were no longer in any position to pursue their French claims and lost all their land on the continent, except for Calais. After the turmoils of the Wars of the Roses, the Tudor dynasty ruled during the English Renaissance and again extended English monarchical power beyond England proper, achieving the full union of England and the Principality of Wales in 1542. Henry VIII oversaw the English Reformation, and his daughter Elizabeth I (reigned 1558–1603) the Elizabethan Religious Settlement, meanwhile establishing England as a great power and laying the foundations of the British Empire by claiming possessions in the New World. From the accession of James I in 1603, the Stuart dynasty ruled England in personal union with Scotland and Ireland. Under the Stuarts, the kingdom plunged into civil war, which culminated in the execution of Charles I in 1649. The monarchy returned in 1660, but the Civil War established the precedent that an English monarch cannot govern without the consent of Parliament, although this concept became legally established only as part of the Glorious Revolution of 1688.From this time the kingdom of England, as well as its successor state the United Kingdom, functioned in effect as a constitutional monarchy. On 1 May 1707, under the terms of the Acts of Union 1707, the kingdoms of England and Scotland united to form the Kingdom of Great Britain.","[('England', 'Winchester', 'capital city', 'P36'), ('England', 'Winchester', 'capital', 'P36'), ('England', 'Westminster', 'capital city', 'P36'), ('England', 'Westminster', 'capital', 'P36'), ('England', 'London', 'capital city', 'P36'), ('England', 'London', 'capital', 'P36'), ('English', 'Winchester', 'capital city', 'P36'), ('English', 'Winchester', 'capital', 'P36'), ('English', 'Westminster', 'capital city', 'P36'), ('English', 'Westminster', 'capital', 'P36'), ('English', 'London', 'capital city', 'P36'), ('English', 'London', 'capital', 'P36'), ('England', 'Winchester', 'capital city', 'P36'), ('England', 'Winchester', 'capital', 'P36'), ('England', 'Westminster', 'capital city', 'P36'), ('England', 'Westminster', 'capital', 'P36'), ('England', 'London', 'capital city', 'P36'), ('England', 'London', 'capital', 'P36'), ('Henry II', 'Norman', 'dynasty', 'P53'), ('Henry II', 'Plantagenet', 'dynasty', 'P53'), ('Henry II', 'Plantagenets', 'dynasty', 'P53'), ('Henry II', 'Angevin kings', 'dynasty', 'P53'), ('Henry II', 'Plantagenet', 'dynasty', 'P53'), ('Edward III', 'Plantagenet', 'dynasty', 'P53'), ('Edward III', 'Plantagenets', 'dynasty', 'P53'), ('Edward III', 'Angevin kings', 'dynasty', 'P53'), ('Edward III', 'Plantagenet', 'dynasty', 'P53'), ('James VI', 'Stuart', 'dynasty', 'P53'), ('James VI', 'Stuart', 'dynasty', 'P53'), ('England', 'English parliament', 'parliament', 'P194'), ('Henry VIII', 'Elizabeth I', 'daughter', 'P40'), ('James I', 'Stuart dynasty', 'dynasty', 'P53'), ('Parliament', 'English', 'state', 'P17'), ('Parliament', 'England', 'state', 'P17')]","['The Kingdom of England /ˈɪŋɡlənd/ was a sovereign state on the island of Great Britain from the 10th century—when it emerged from various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms—until 1707—when it was united with Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain.', 'In the early 11th century the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, united by Æthelstan (r. 927–939), became part of the North Sea Empire of Cnut the Great, a personal union between England, Denmark and Norway.', ""The Norman conquest of England in 1066 led to the transfer of the English capital city and chief royal residence from the Anglo-Saxon one at Winchester to Westminster, and the City of London quickly established itself as England's largest and principal commercial centre."", 'Histories of the kingdom of England from the Norman conquest of 1066 conventionally distinguish periods named after successive ruling dynasties: Norman 1066–1154, Plantagenet 1154–1485, Tudor 1485–1603 and Stuart 1603–1714 (interrupted by the Interregnum of 1649–1660).Dynastically, all English monarchs after 1066 ultimately claim descent from the Normans;

Thalasssery has an area of 23.98 square kilometres (9.26 sq mi). It is 22 km south of the district headquarters in Kannur town. Thalassery is situated in an altitude ranging from 2.5m to 30m above mean sea-level. Thalassery municipality was formed on 1 November 1866 according to the Madras Act 10 of 1865 (Amendment of the Improvements in Towns act 1850) of the British Indian Empire, making it the second oldest municipality in the state. At that time the municipality was known as Thalassery Commission, and Thalassery was the capital of North Malabar. G. M. Ballard, the Malabar collector, was the first President of the municipal commission. Later a European barrister, A. F. Lamaral, became the first Chairman of Thalassery municipality. Thalassery grew into a prominent place during European rule, due to its strategic geographic location. Thalassery has played a significant historical, cultural, educational and commercial role in the history of India, especially during the colonial period. On 9 February 2014, Thalassery taluk was split in two and Iritty taluk was formed. The north eastern hilly region of the former Thalassery Taluk such as Aralam, Ayyankunnu, Kottiyur, Kelakam is within the Iritty Taluk area.","[('Thalassery', 'Kannur district', 'town', 'P131'), ('Tellicherry', 'Kannur district', 'town', 'P131'), ('Kannur district', 'Kerala', 'town', 'P131'), ('Kannur district', 'Mahé', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Kannur district', 'Kozhikode', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Kannur district', 'Wayanad', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Kannur district', 'Kodagu', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Kerala', 'Pondicherry', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Kerala', 'Karnataka', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Mahé', 'Kannur district', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Mahé', 'Kozhikode', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Pondicherry', 'Kerala', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Kozhikode', 'Kannur district', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Kozhikode', 'Kerala', 'town', 'P131'), ('Kozhikode', 'Mahé', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Kozhikode', 'Wayanad', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Wayanad', 'Kannur district', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Wayanad', 'Kerala', 'town', 'P131'), ('Wayanad', 'Kozhikode', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Kodagu', 'Kannur district', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Kodagu', 'Karnataka', 'town', 'P131'), ('Karnataka', 'Kerala', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Madras', 'British Indian Empire', 'state', 'P17')]","['Thalassery ([t̪laʃeɾi]) (formerly Tellicherry) is a commercial town on the Malabar Coast in Kannur district, in the state of Kerala, India, bordered by the districts of Mahé (Pondicherry), Kozhikode, Wayanad and Kodagu (Karnataka).It is the largest populated municipality of North Malabar.', 'The Europeans nicknamed the town ""Paris"" or in other words ""The Paris of Kerala"", as it was the sole French military base in Kerala in that era.', 'Thalassery has been significant during the past 500 years in the development of Kerala.', 'Thalassery municipality has a population just under 100,000.', 'Thalasssery has an area of 23.98 square kilometres (9.26 sq mi).', 'It is 22 km south of the district headquarters in Kannur town.', 'Thalassery is situated in an altitude ranging from 2.5m to 30m above mean sea-level.', 'Thalassery municipality was formed on 1 November 1866 according to the Madras Act 10 of 1865 (Amendment of the Improvements in Towns act 1850) of the British Indian Empire, making it the second oldest municipality in the state.', 'At that time the municipality was known as Thalassery Commission, and Thalassery was the capital of North Malabar.', 'G.

"The Yugoslav Wars were ethnic conflicts fought from 1991 to 2001 inside the territory of the former Yugoslavia. These wars accompanied and/or facilitated the breakup of the country, when its constituent republics declared independence, but the issues of ethnic minorities in the new countries (chiefly Serbs in central parts and Albanians in the southeast) were still unresolved at the time the republics were recognized internationally. The wars are generally considered to be a series of separate but related military conflicts which occurred in, and affected, most of the former Yugoslav republics: The wars mostly resulted in peace accords, involving full international recognition of new states, but with massive economic damage to the region.Initially the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) sought to preserve the unity of the whole of Yugoslavia by crushing the secessionist governments; however the JNA increasingly came under the influence of the Serbian government of Slobodan Milošević that evoked Serbian nationalist rhetoric and was willing to support the Yugoslav state insofar as using it to preserve the unity of Serbs in one state; as a result the JNA began to lose Slovenes, Croats, Kosovar Albanians, Bosniaks, and ethnic Macedonians, and effectively became a Serb army. According to the 1994 United Nations report, the Serb side did not aim to restore Yugoslavia, but to create a ""Greater Serbia"" from parts of Croatia and Bosnia. Often described as Europe's deadliest conflict since World War II, the conflicts have become infamous for the war crimes involved, including ethnic cleansing, crimes against humanity and rape. These were the first European conflicts since World War II to be formally judged genocidal in character and many key individual participants were subsequently charged with war crimes. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) was established by the UN to prosecute these crimes.

"Arsinoe I (Greek: Αρσινόη Α’, 305 BC-after c. 248 BC) was a Greek Princess who was of Macedonian and Thessalian descent. She was the second daughter and youngest child born to King Lysimachus from his first wife, Nicaea of Macedon. Arsinoe I had two older siblings: a brother called Agathocles and a sister called Eurydice. Her paternal grandfather was Agathocles of Pella a nobleman who was a contemporary to King Philip II of Macedon who reigned 359-336 BC, while her maternal grandfather was the powerful Regent Antipater. Arsinoe I was named in honor of an unnamed grandmother, who may have been the mother of Lysimachus or the mother of Nicaea whose both names of these women are unknown. Little is known of her life prior to her marriage. Between 289/28 and 281 BC, Arsinoe became the first wife of Ptolemaic Greek Egyptian Pharaoh Ptolemy II Philadelphus, who was also her distant maternal cousin. Arsinoe I married Ptolemy II as part of an alliance between her father and Ptolemy II, against Seleucus I Nicator. Arsinoe I was, by marriage, Queen of the Ptolemaic Kingdom. Arsinoe I bore Ptolemy II three children; two sons: Ptolemy III Euergetes, Lysimachus of Egypt and a daughter called Berenice. At an unknown date between after 279-274/3 BC, a sister of Ptolemy II called Arsinoe II arrived in Egypt, who was the last wife of Lysimachus and had fled from her half-brother-husband Ptolemy Keraunos. Probably at the instigation of Arsinoe II, charges of conspiring to assassinate Ptolemy II were soon brought against Arsinoe I. Ptolemy II had convicted Arsinoe I of plotting against him. He ended his marriage to Arsinoe I and divorced her. Ptolemy II had exiled Arsinoe I to Coptos in southern Egypt. It is chronologically plausible that these events were also connected to the banishment of Ptolemy II’s niece, Theoxena of Egypt as Theoxena was sent to the Thebaid, perhaps to Coptos. Afterwards Ptolemy II married his sister Arsinoe II and after the death of Arsinoe II, Ptolemy II’s children with Arsinoe I were officially regarded as the children of Arsinoe II. Arsinoe I lived in exile for twenty years. During her exile, Arsinoe I lived in great splendour and exercised considerable power, since she was a wife of a former pharaoh. Her first son with Ptolemy II succeeded his father after his death. A surviving Stele has been found at Coptos which refers to Arsinoe I. The Stele is of Senu-sher, a steward of Arsinoe I and the Stele is assigned to Arsinoe I’s exile. The stele calls Arsinoe I the ‘king’s wife’, but her name is not enclosed in the royal Cartouche, as it is customary for an Egyptian Queen.

"Jacob Two-Two is a series of children's books written by Mordecai Richler: Jacob Two-Two Meets the Hooded Fang (1975), Jacob Two-Two and the Dinosaur (1987) and Jacob Two-Two's First Spy Case (1995) written by Mordecai Richler, and Jacob Two-Two on the High Seas (2009) written by Cary Fagan. Jacob is the youngest child of five and has to say things twice because people do not hear him the first time. Jacob Two-Two Meets the Hooded Fang has twice been filmed, in 1978 and in 1999, the latter film starring Gary Busey. The titles by Mordecai Richler have inspired an animated TV series produced by Nelvana, and seen in Canada on YTV (English) and VRAK.TV (French), and in the United States on Qubo. The character is said to have been inspired by Jacob Richler, the author's youngest son. Every character in Jacob's family has the same name as their counterpart in the real Richler family. However, despite the names, Richler stated that the characters were not based on his family. In September 2009 Tundra Books, the publisher of the Jacob Two-Two series, released a new fourth book titled Jacob Two-Two on the High Seas. Mordecai Richler had always planned to write new adventures and had started a fourth book before he died in 2001. With the full support of the Richler family, the new book was written by Canadian author Cary Fagan. It is the prequel to the first three books with the family sailing back to Canada from England after Jacob's father writes an important novel. Tundra will also re-release the previous three titles in the series with new art and covers by Toronto artist, Dušan Petričić.","[('Jacob Two-Two', 'Mordecai Richler', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Jacob Two-Two', 'Mordecai Richler', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Jacob Two-Two', 'Mordecai Richler', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Jacob Two-Two', 'Mordecai Richler', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Jacob Two-Two', 'Mordecai Richler', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Jacob Two-Two', 'Mordecai Richler', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Jacob Two-Two', 'Mordecai Richler', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Jacob Two-Two', 'Mordecai Richler', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Jacob Two-Two', 'Mordecai Richler', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Jacob Two-Two', 'Mordecai Richler', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Jacob Two-Two', 'Mordecai Richler', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Jacob Two-Two', 'Mordecai Richler', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Jacob Two-Two', 'Mordecai Richler', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Jacob Two-Two', 'Mordecai Richler', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Jacob Two-Two', 'Mordecai Richler', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Jacob Two-Two', 'Mordecai Richler', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Jacob Two-Two', 'Mordecai Richler', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Jacob Two-Two', 'Mordecai Richler', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Jacob Two-Two', 'Mordecai Richler', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Jacob Two-Two', 'Mordecai Richler', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Jacob Two-Two', 'Mordecai Richler', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Jacob Two-Two', 'Mordecai Richler', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Jacob Two-Two', 'Mordecai Richler', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Jacob Two-Two', 'Mordecai Richler', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Jacob Two-Two', 'Mordecai Richler', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Jacob Two-Two', 'Mordecai Richler', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Jacob Two-Two', 'Mordecai Richler', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Jacob Two-Two', 'Mordecai Richler', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Jacob Two-Two', 'Mordecai Richler', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Jacob Two-Two', 'Mordecai Richler', 'written by', 'P50')]","[""Jacob Two-Two is a series of children's books written by Mordecai Richler: Jacob Two-Two Meets the Hooded Fang (1975), Jacob Two-Two and the Dinosaur (1987) and Jacob Two-Two's First Spy Case (1995) written by Mordecai Richler, and Jacob Two-Two on the High Seas (2009) written by Cary Fagan."", 'Jacob is the youngest child of five and has to say things twice because people do not hear him the first time.', 'Jacob Two-Two Meets the Hooded Fang has twice been filmed, in 1978 and in 1999, the latter film starring Gary Busey.', 'The titles by Mordecai Richler have inspired an animated TV series produced by Nelvana, and seen in Canada on YTV (English) and VRAK.TV (French), and in the United States on Qubo.', ""The character is said to have been inspired by Jacob Richler, the author's youngest son."", ""Every character in Jacob's family has the same name as their counterpart in the real Richler family."", 'However, despite the names, Richler stated that the characters were not based on his family.', 'In September 2009 Tundra Books, the publisher of the Jacob Two-Two series, released a new fourth book titled Jacob Two-Two on the High Seas.', 'Mordecai Richler had always planned to write new adventures and had started a fourth book before he died in 2001.', 'With the full support of the Richler family, the new book was written by Canadian author Cary Fagan.', ""It is the prequel to the first three books with the family sailing back to Canada from England after Jacob's father writes an important novel."", 'Tundra will also re-release the previous three titles in the series with new art and covers by Toronto artist, Dušan Petričić.']",12,292,48

This family is mainly based in the Mesopotamian region[citation needed], they also live in other Middle Eastern, most notably Iraq. Though no written records or genetics studies done on this family, verbal history claims that the name implies that this person is a direct descendant of the Islamic prophet Muhammad through the seventh of the Shi'a twelve Imams: Musa al-Kazim ibn Jafar as Sadiq who is a grandson of Muhammad.

"The Tumuk Humak Mountains (Dutch: Toemoek-Hoemakgebergte, Portuguese: Serra do Tumucumaque, French: Monts Tumuc Humac) are a mountain range in South America, stretching about 120 kilometers (75 mi) east–west in the border area between Brazil in the south and Suriname and French Guiana in the north. In the language of the Apalam and Wayana peoples, Tumucumaque means ""the mountain rock symbolizing the struggle between the shaman and the spirits"". The range is very remote and almost inaccessible. Both the Maroni and Oyapock rivers originate in the Tumuk Humak Mountains. The Maroni (Dutch: Marowijne) forms the entire (disputed) border between Suriname and French Guiana, and the Oyapock (Portuguese: Oiapoque) most of the border between French Guiana and Brazil. The Tumuk Humak Mountains are part of the Tumucumaque Uplands of the Guiana Shield. They are geographically important because they form the divide between the biogeographical system of the Amazon Basin and that of the Atlantic coastal area of the Guianas. The Tumuk Humak plateau is covered primarily with lowland and plateau forests.

"Arizona (/ɛrɪˈzoʊnə/; /ærɪˈzoʊnə/) (Navajo: Hoozdo Hahoodzo; O'odham: Alĭ ṣonak) is a state in the southwestern region of the United States. It is also part of the Western United States and of the Mountain West states. It is the sixth largest and the 14th most populous of the 50 states. Its capital and largest city is Phoenix. Arizona is one of the Four Corners states. It has borders with New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, California, and Mexico, and one point in common with the southwestern corner of Colorado. Arizona's border with Mexico is 389 miles (626 km) long, on the northern border of the Mexican states of Sonora and Baja California. Arizona is the 48th state and last of the contiguous states to be admitted to the Union, achieving statehood on February 14, 1912. It was previously part of the territory of Alta California in New Spain before being passed down to independent Mexico and later ceded to the United States after the Mexican–American War. The southernmost portion of the state was acquired in 1853 through the Gadsden Purchase. Southern Arizona is known for its desert climate, with very hot summers and mild winters. Northern Arizona features forests of pine, Douglas fir, and spruce trees; the Colorado Plateau; some mountain ranges (such as the San Francisco Mountains); as well as large, deep canyons, with much more moderate summer temperatures and significant winter snowfalls. There are ski resorts in the areas of Flagstaff, Alpine, and Tucson. In addition to the Grand Canyon National Park, there are several national forests, national parks, and national monuments. About one-quarter of the state is made up of Indian reservations that serve as the home of a number of Native American tribes.","[('Arizona', 'United States', 'state', 'P17'), ('New Mexico', 'Utah', 'borders', 'P47'), ('New Mexico', 'Colorado', 'borders', 'P47'), ('New Mexico', 'It', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Utah', 'New Mexico', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Utah', 'Nevada', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Utah', 'Colorado', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Utah', 'It', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Nevada', 'Utah', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Nevada', 'California', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Nevada', 'It', 'borders', 'P47'), ('California', 'Nevada', 'borders', 'P47'), ('California', 'It', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Colorado', 'New Mexico', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Colorado', 'Utah', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Colorado', 'It', 'borders', 'P47'), ('It', 'New Mexico', 'borders', 'P47'), ('It', 'Utah', 'borders', 'P47'), ('It', 'Nevada', 'borders', 'P47'), ('It', 'California', 'borders', 'P47'), ('It', 'Colorado', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Arizona', 'Sonora', 'border', 'P47'), ('Arizona', 'Sonora', 'border', 'P47'), ('Arizona', 'Baja California', 'border', 'P47'), ('Arizona', 'Baja California', 'border', 'P47'), ('Sonora', 'Arizona', 'border', 'P47'), ('Sonora', 'Arizona', 'border', 'P47'), ('Sonora', 'Baja California', 'border', 'P47'), ('Sonora', 'Baja California', 'border', 'P47'), ('Baja California', 'Arizona', 'border', 'P47'), ('Baja California', 'Arizona', 'border', 'P47'), ('Baja California', 'Sonora', 'border', 'P47'), ('Baja California', 'Sonora', 'border', 'P47'), ('Arizona', 'Union', 'state', 'P17')]","[""Arizona (/ɛrɪˈzoʊnə/; /ærɪˈzoʊnə/) (Navajo: Hoozdo Hahoodzo; O'odham: Alĭ ṣonak) is a state in the southwestern region of the United States."", 'It is also part of the Western United States and of the Mountain West states.', 'It is the sixth largest and the 14th most populous of the 50 states.', 'Its capital and largest city is Phoenix.', 'Arizona is one of the Four Corners states.', 'It has borders with New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, California, and Mexico, and one point in common with the southwestern corner of Colorado.', ""Arizona's border with Mexico is 389 miles (626 km) long, on the northern border of the Mexican states of Sonora and Baja California."", 'Arizona is the 48th state and last of the contiguous states to be admitted to the Union, achieving statehood on February 14, 1912.', 'It was previously part of the territory of Alta California in New Spain before being passed down to independent Mexico and later ceded to the United States after the Mexican–American War.', 'The southernmost portion of the state was acquired in 1853 through the Gadsden Purchase.', 'Southern Arizona is known for its desert climate, with very hot summers and mild winters.', 'Northern Arizona features forests of pine, Douglas fir, and spruce trees; the Colorado Plateau; some mountain ranges (such as the San Francisco Mountains); as well as large, deep canyons, with much more moderate summer temperatures and significant winter snowfalls.', 'There are ski resorts in the areas of Flagstaff, Alpine, and Tucson.', 'In addition to the Grand Canyon National Park, there are several national forests, national parks, and national monuments.', 'About one-quarter of the state is made up of Indian reservations that serve as the home of a number of Native American tribes.']",15,265,39

"The Netherlands (/ˈnɛðərləndz/; Dutch: Nederland [ˈneːdərˌlɑnt]) is the main ""constituent country"" (Dutch: land) of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is a small, densely populated country located in Western Europe with three island territories in the Caribbean. The European part of the Netherlands borders Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, sharing maritime borders with Belgium, the United Kingdom and Germany. The largest and most important cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, The Hague and Rotterdam. Amsterdam is the country's capital, while The Hague holds the Dutch seat of government and parliament. The port of Rotterdam is the largest port in Europe – as large as the next three largest combined – and was the world's largest port between 1962 and 2004. The name Holland is also frequently used to refer informally to the whole of the country of the Netherlands. ""Netherlands"" literally means ""lower countries"", influenced by its low land and flat geography, with only about 50% of its land exceeding one metre above sea level. Most of the areas below sea level are man-made. Since the late 16th century, large areas (polders) have been reclaimed from the sea and lakes, amounting to nearly 17% of the country's current land mass. With a population density of 408 people per km2 – 500 if water is excluded – the Netherlands is a very densely populated country for its size. Only Bangladesh, South Korea, and Taiwan have a larger population and a higher population density. Nevertheless, the Netherlands is the world's second-largest exporter of food and agricultural products, after the United States. This is partly due to the fertility of the soil and the mild climate. The Netherlands was the third country in the world to have an elected parliament, and since 1848 it has been governed as a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy, organised as a unitary state. The Netherlands has a long history of social tolerance and is generally regarded as a liberal country, having legalised abortion, prostitution and euthanasia, while maintaining a progressive drugs policy. In 2001, it became the world's first country to legalise same-sex marriage. The Netherlands is a founding member of the EU, Eurozone, G-10, NATO, OECD and WTO, and a part of the trilateral Benelux Union. The country is host to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and five international courts: the Permanent Court of Arbitration, the International Court of Justice, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, the International Criminal Court and the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. The first four are situated in The Hague, as is the EU's criminal intelligence agency Europol and judicial co-operation agency Eurojust. This has led to the city being dubbed ""the world's legal capital"". The Netherlands is also a part of the Schengen Area. The Netherlands has a market-based mixed economy, ranking 17th of 177 countries according to the Index of Economic Freedom. It had the thirteenth-highest per capita income in the world in 2013 according to the International Monetary Fund.

"North Korea (About this sound listen), officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK; Chosŏn'gŭl: 조선민주주의인민공화국; hancha: 朝鮮民主主義人民共和國; MR: Chosŏn Minjujuŭi Inmin Konghwaguk), is a country in East Asia, in the northern part of the Korean Peninsula. The name Korea is derived from the Kingdom of Goguryeo, also spelled as Koryŏ. The capital and largest city is Pyongyang. North Korea shares a land border with China to the north and northwest, along the Amnok (Yalu) and Tumen rivers, and a small section of the Tumen River also forms a border with Russia to the northeast. The Korean Demilitarized Zone marks the boundary between North Korea and South Korea. Korea was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. After the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in 1945, Korea was divided into two zones by the United States and the Soviet Union, with the north occupied by the Soviets and the south by the Americans. Negotiations on reunification failed, and in 1948 two separate governments were formed: the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the north, and the Republic of Korea in the south. An invasion initiated by North Korea led to the Korean War (1950–53). Although the Korean Armistice Agreement brought about a ceasefire, no official peace treaty was ever signed. Both states were accepted into the United Nations in 1991. The DPRK officially describes itself as a self-reliant socialist state and holds elections. However, critics regard it as a totalitarian dictatorship. Various outlets have called it Stalinist, particularly noting the elaborate cult of personality around Kim Il-sung and his family. International organizations have also assessed human rights violations in North Korea as belonging to a category of their own, with no parallel in the contemporary world. The Workers' Party of Korea, led by a member of the ruling family, holds power in the state and leads the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland of which all political officers are required to be members. Over time North Korea has gradually distanced itself from the world communist movement. Juche, an ideology of national self-reliance, was introduced into the constitution as a ""creative application of Marxism–Leninism"" in 1972. The means of production are owned by the state through state-run enterprises and collectivized farms. Most services such as healthcare, education, housing and food production are subsidized or state-funded. In the late 1990s, North Korea suffered from a famine that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians. North Korea continues to struggle with food production to this day. North Korea follows Songun, or ""military-first"" policy.

"Namibia (/nəˈmɪbiə/, /næˈ-/), officially the Republic of Namibia (German: About this sound Republik Namibia ; Afrikaans: Republiek van Namibië), and formerly German South-West Africa and then South West Africa, is a country in southern Africa whose western border is the Atlantic Ocean. It shares land borders with Zambia and Angola to the north, Botswana to the east and South Africa to the south and east. Although it does not border Zimbabwe, less than 200 metres of the Zambezi River (essentially a small bulge in Botswana to achieve a Botswana/Zambia micro-border) separates them at their closest points. It gained independence from South Africa on 21 March 1990, following the Namibian War of Independence. Its capital and largest city is Windhoek. Namibia is a member state of the United Nations (UN), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the African Union (AU), and the Commonwealth of Nations. The dry lands of Namibia were inhabited since early times by San, Damara, and Namaqua, and since about the 14th century AD by immigrating Bantu who came with the Bantu expansion. Most of the territory became a German Imperial protectorate in 1884 and remained a German colony until the end of World War I. In 1920, the League of Nations mandated the country to South Africa, which imposed its laws and, from 1948, its apartheid policy. The port of Walvis Bay and the offshore Penguin Islands had been annexed by the Cape Colony under the British crown by 1878 and had become an integral part of the new Union of South Africa at its creation in 1910. Uprisings and demands by African leaders led the UN to assume direct responsibility over the territory. It recognised the South West Africa People's Organisation (SWAPO) as the official representative of the Namibian people in 1973. Namibia, however, remained under South African administration during this time as South-West Africa. Following internal violence, South Africa installed an interim administration in Namibia in 1985. Namibia obtained full independence from South Africa in 1990, with the exception of Walvis Bay and the Penguin Islands, which remained under South African control until 1994. Namibia has a population of 2.1 million people and a stable multi-party parliamentary democracy. Agriculture, herding, tourism and the mining industry – including mining for gem diamonds, uranium, gold, silver, and base metals – form the basis of Namibia's economy. Given the presence of the arid Namib Desert, it is one of the least densely populated countries in the world. Namibia enjoys high political, economic and social stability.","[('Namibia', 'southern Africa', 'border', 'P47'), ('Namibia', 'southern Africa', 'border', 'P47'), ('Namibia', 'southern Africa', 'border', 'P47'), ('southern Africa', 'Namibia', 'border', 'P47'), ('southern Africa', 'Namibia', 'border', 'P47'), ('southern Africa', 'Namibia', 'border', 'P47'), ('Zambia', 'Angola', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Zambia', 'Botswana', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Zambia', 'It', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Angola', 'Zambia', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Angola', 'It', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Botswana', 'Zambia', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Botswana', 'South Africa', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Botswana', 'It', 'borders', 'P47'), ('South Africa', 'Botswana', 'borders', 'P47'), ('South Africa', 'It', 'borders', 'P47'), ('It', 'Zambia', 'borders', 'P47'), ('It', 'Angola', 'borders', 'P47'), ('It', 'Botswana', 'borders', 'P47'), ('It', 'South Africa', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Zimbabwe', 'Botswana', 'border', 'P47'), ('Zimbabwe', 'Botswana', 'border', 'P47'), ('Zimbabwe', 'Botswana', 'border', 'P47'), ('Zimbabwe', 'Botswana', 'border', 'P47'), ('Zimbabwe', 'Zambia', 'border', 'P47'), ('Zimbabwe', 'Zambia', 'border', 'P47'), ('Botswana', 'Zimbabwe', 'border', 'P47'), ('Botswana', 'Zimbabwe', 'border', 'P47'), ('Botswana', 'Zambia', 'border', 'P47'), ('Botswana', 'Zambia', 'border', 'P47'), ('Botswana', 'Zimbabwe', 'border', 'P47'), ('Botswana', 'Zimbabwe', 'border', 'P47'), ('Botswana', 'Zambia', 'border', 'P47'), ('Botswana', 'Zambia', 'border', 'P47'), ('Zambia', 'Zimbabwe', 'border', 'P47'), ('Zambia', 'Zimbabwe', 'border', 'P47'), ('Zambia', 'Botswana', 'border', 'P47'), ('Zambia', 'Botswana', 'border', 'P47'), ('Zambia', 'Botswana', 'border', 'P47'), ('Zambia', 'Botswana', 'border', 'P47')]","['Namibia (/nəˈmɪbiə/, /næˈ-/), officially the Republic of Namibia (German: About this sound Republik Namibia ; Afrikaans: Republiek van Namibië), and formerly German South-West Africa and then South West Africa, is a country in southern Africa whose western border is the Atlantic Ocean.', 'It shares land borders with Zambia and Angola to the north, Botswana to the east and South Africa to the south and east.', 'Although it does not border Zimbabwe, less than 200 metres of the Zambezi River (essentially a small bulge in Botswana to achieve a Botswana/Zambia micro-border) separates them at their closest points.', 'It gained independence from South Africa on 21 March 1990, following the Namibian War of Independence.', 'Its capital and largest city is Windhoek.', 'Namibia is a member state of the United Nations (UN), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the African Union (AU), and the Commonwealth of Nations.', 'The dry lands of Namibia were inhabited since early times by San, Damara, and Namaqua, and since about the 14th century AD by immigrating Bantu who came with the Bantu expansion.', 'Most of the territory became a German Imperial protectorate in 1884 and remained a German colony until the end of World War I.', 'In 1920, the League of Nations mandated the country to South Africa, which imposed its laws and, from 1948, its apartheid policy.', 'The port of Walvis Bay and the offshore Penguin Islands had been annexed by the Cape Colony under the British crown by 1878 and had become an integral part of the new Union of South Africa at its creation in 1910.', 'Uprisings and demands by African leaders led the UN to assume direct responsibility over the territory.', ""It recognised the South West Africa People's Organisation (SWAPO) as the official representative of the Namibian people in 1973."", 'Namibia, however, remained under South African administration during this time as South-West Africa.', 'Following internal violence, South Africa installed an interim administration in Namibia in 1985.', 'Namibia obtained full independence from South Africa in 1990, with the exception of Walvis Bay and the Penguin Islands, which remained under South African control until 1994.', 'Namibia has a population of 2.1 million people and a stable multi-party parliamentary democracy.', ""Agriculture, herding, tourism and the mining industry – including mining for gem diamonds, uranium, gold, silver, and base metals – form the basis of Namibia's economy."", 'Given the presence of the arid Namib Desert, it is one of the least densely populated countries in the world.', 'Namibia enjoys high political, economic and social stability.']",19,286,42
"Niger (/ˈnaɪdʒər/ or /niːˈʒɛər/; [niʒɛʁ]), officially the Republic of Niger, is a landlocked country in Western Africa, named after the Niger River. Niger is bordered by Libya to the northeast, Chad to the east, Nigeria and Benin to the south, Burkina Faso and Mali to the west, and Algeria to the northwest. Niger covers a land area of almost 1,270,000 km2, making it the largest country in West Africa, with over 80 percent of its land area covered by the Sahara Desert. The country's predominantly Islamic population of 17,138,707 is mostly clustered in the far south and west of the country. The capital city is Niamey, located in the far-southwest corner of Niger. Niger is a developing country, and is consistently one of the lowest-ranked in the United Nations' Human Development Index (HDI); it was ranked last at 188th for 2014. Much of the non-desert portions of the country are threatened by periodic drought and desertification. The economy is concentrated around subsistence and some export agriculture clustered in the more fertile south, and the export of raw materials, especially uranium ore. Niger faces serious challenges to development due to its landlocked position, desert terrain, high fertility rates and resulting overpopulation without birth control, poor education and poverty of its people, lack of infrastructure, poor health care, and environmental degradation. Nigerien society reflects a diversity drawn from the long independent histories of its several ethnic groups and regions and their relatively short period living in a single state. Historically, what is now Niger has been on the fringes of several large states. Since independence, Nigeriens have lived under five constitutions and three periods of military rule. Following a military coup in 2010, Niger has become a democratic, multi-party state. A majority live in rural areas, and have little access to advanced education.","[('Niger', 'landlocked country', 'is a', 'P31'), ('Niger', 'Niger River', 'named after', 'P138'), ('Niger', 'landlocked country', 'is a', 'P31'), ('Niger', 'Niger River', 'named after', 'P138'), ('Niger River', 'Niger', 'country', 'P17'), ('Niger River', 'Niger', 'country', 'P17'), ('Niger', 'Libya', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Niger', 'Chad', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Niger', 'Nigeria', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Niger', 'Benin', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Niger', 'Burkina Faso', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Niger', 'Mali', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Niger', 'Algeria', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Libya', 'Niger', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Libya', 'Chad', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Libya', 'Algeria', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Chad', 'Niger', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Chad', 'Libya', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Chad', 'Nigeria', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Nigeria', 'Niger', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Nigeria', 'Chad', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Nigeria', 'Benin', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Benin', 'Niger', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Benin', 'Nigeria', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Benin', 'Burkina Faso', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Burkina Faso', 'Niger', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Burkina Faso', 'Benin', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Burkina Faso', 'Mali', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Mali', 'Niger', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Mali', 'Burkina Faso', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Mali', 'Algeria', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Algeria', 'Niger', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Algeria', 'Libya', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Algeria', 'Mali', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Niamey', 'Niger', 'city', 'P131'), ('Niger', 'Niamey', 'capital city', 'P36'), ('Niger', 'Niamey', 'capital', 'P36')]","['Niger (/ˈnaɪdʒər/ or /niːˈʒɛər/; [niʒɛʁ]), officially the Republic of Niger, is a landlocked country in Western Africa, named after the Niger River.', 'Niger is bordered by Libya to the northeast, Chad to the east, Nigeria and Benin to the south, Burkina Faso and Mali to the west, and Algeria to the northwest.', 'Niger covers a land area of almost 1,270,000 km2, making it the largest country in West Africa, with over 80 percent of its land area covered by the Sahara Desert.', ""The country's predominantly Islamic population of 17,138,707 is mostly clustered in the far south and west of the country."", 'The capital city is Niamey, located in the far-southwest corner of Niger.', ""Niger is a developing country, and is consistently one of the lowest-ranked in the United Nations' Human Development Index (HDI); it was ranked last at 188th for 2014."", 'Much of the non-desert portions of the country are threatened by periodic drought and desertification.', 'The economy is concentrated around subsistence and some export agriculture clustered in the more fertile south, and the export of raw materials, especially uranium ore.

"Nanjing (About this sound listen; Chinese: 南京, ""Southern Capital"") is the city situated in the heartland of lower Yangtze River region in China, which has long been a major centre of culture, education, research, politics, economy, transport networks and tourism. It is the capital city of Jiangsu province of People's Republic of China and the second largest city in East China, with a total population of 8,216,100, and legally the capital of Republic of China which lost the mainland during the civil war. The city whose name means ""Southern Capital"" has a prominent place in Chinese history and culture, having served as the capitals of various Chinese dynasties, kingdoms and republican governments dating from the 3rd century AD to 1949. Prior to the advent of pinyin romanization, Nanjing's city name was spelled as Nanking or Nankin. Nanjing has a number of other names, and some historical names are now used as names of districts of the city, and among them there is the name Jiangning (江寧), whose former character Jiang (江, River) is the former part of the name Jiangsu and latter character Ning (寧, simplified form 宁, Peace) is the short name of Nanjing. When being the capital of a state, for instance, ROC, Jing (京) is adopted as the abbreviation of Nanjing. Although as a city located in southern part of China becoming Chinese national capital as early as in Jin dynasty, the name Nanjing was designated to the city in Ming dynasty, about a thousand years later. Nanjing is particularly known as Jinling (金陵, literally meaning Gold Mountain) and the old name has been used since the Warring States Period in Zhou Dynasty. Located in Yangtze River Delta area and the center of East China, Nanjing is home to one of the world's largest inland ports. Nanjing is also one of the fifteen sub-provincial cities in the People's Republic of China's administrative structure, enjoying jurisdictional and economic autonomy only slightly less than that of a province. Nanjing has been ranked seventh in the evaluation of ""Cities with Strongest Comprehensive Strength"" issued by the National Statistics Bureau, and second in the evaluation of cities with most sustainable development potential in the Yangtze River Delta. It has also been awarded the title of 2008 Habitat Scroll of Honour of China, Special UN Habitat Scroll of Honour Award and National Civilized City. Nanjing boasts many high-quality universities and research institutes, with the number of universities listed in 100 National Key Universities ranking third, including Nanjing University. The ratio of college students to total population ranks No.1 among large cities nationwide. Nanjing is one of the three Chinese top research centres according to Nature Index. Nanjing, one of the nation's most important cities for over a thousand years, is recognized as one of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China, and had been the world's largest city aggregately for hundreds of years, enjoyed peace and prosperity and beared wars and disasters. Nanjing served as the capital of Eastern Wu, one of the three major states in the Three Kingdoms period (211-280); the Eastern Jin and each of the Southern Dynasties (Liu Song, Southern Qi, Liang and Chen), which successively ruled southern China from 317-589; the Southern Tang, one of the Ten Kingdoms (937-76); the Ming dynasty when, for the first time, all of China was ruled from the city (1368-1421); and the Republic of China (1927–37, 1945–49) prior to its flight to Taiwan during the Chinese Civil War. The city also served as the seat of the rebel Taiping Heavenly Kingdom (1851–64) and the Japanese puppet regime of Wang Jingwei (1940–45) during the Second Sino-Japanese War, and suffered appalling atrocities in both conflicts, including the Nanjing Massacre. It has been serving as the capital city of Jiangsu province after the China was established, and is still the nominal capital of Republic of China that accommodates many of its important heritage sites, including the Presidential Palace and Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. Nanjing is famous for human historical landscapes, mountains and waters such as Fuzimiao, Ming Palace, Chaotian Palace, Porcelain Tower, Drum Tower, Stone City, City Wall, Qinhuai River, Xuanwu Lake and Purple Mountain.

"Oman (/oʊˈmɑːn/ oh-MAAN; Arabic: عمان ʻUmān [ˈuːmaːn]), officially the Sultanate of Oman (Arabic: سلطنة عُمان Salṭanat ʻUmān), is an Arab country in the southeastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula. Holding a strategically important position at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, the nation is bordered by the United Arab Emirates to the northwest, Saudi Arabia to the west, and Yemen to the southwest, and shares marine borders with Iran and Pakistan. The coast is formed by the Arabian Sea on the southeast and the Gulf of Oman on the northeast. The Madha and Musandam exclaves are surrounded by the UAE on their land borders, with the Strait of Hormuz (which it shares with Iran) and Gulf of Oman forming Musandam's coastal boundaries. From the late 17th century, the Omani Sultanate was a powerful empire, vying with Portugal and Britain for influence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. At its peak in the 19th century, Omani influence or control extended across the Strait of Hormuz to modern-day Iran and Pakistan, and as far south as Zanzibar (today part of Tanzania, also former capital). As its power declined in the 20th century, the sultanate came under the influence of the United Kingdom. Historically, Muscat was the principal trading port of the Persian Gulf region. Muscat was also among the most important trading ports of the Indian Ocean. Oman's official religion is Islam. Oman is an absolute monarchy. The Sultan Qaboos bin Said al Said has been the hereditary leader of the country since 1970. Sultan Qaboos is the longest-serving ruler in the Middle East. Oman has modest oil reserves, ranking 25th globally. Nevertheless, in 2010 the UNDP ranked Oman as the most improved nation in the world in terms of development during the preceding 40 years. A significant portion of its economy is tourism and trade of fish, dates, and certain agricultural produce. This sets it apart from its neighbors' solely oil-dependent economy. Oman is categorized as a high-income economy and ranks as the 59th most peaceful country in the world according to the Global Peace Index.","[('Arabian Peninsula', 'Oman', 'country', 'P17'), ('Arabian Peninsula', 'Oman', 'country', 'P17'), ('United Arab Emirates', 'Saudi Arabia', 'borders', 'P47'), ('United Arab Emirates', 'Saudi Arabia', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Saudi Arabia', 'United Arab Emirates', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Saudi Arabia', 'United Arab Emirates', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Saudi Arabia', 'Yemen', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Saudi Arabia', 'Yemen', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Yemen', 'Saudi Arabia', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Yemen', 'Saudi Arabia', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Iran', 'Pakistan', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Iran', 'Pakistan', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Pakistan', 'Iran', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Pakistan', 'Iran', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Madha', 'Oman', 'land', 'P17'), ('Musandam', 'Oman', 'land', 'P17'), ('UAE', 'Oman', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Hormuz', 'UAE', 'land', 'P17'), ('Hormuz', 'Iran', 'land', 'P17'), ('Hormuz', 'Oman', 'land', 'P17'), ('Oman', 'UAE', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Musandam', 'Oman', 'land', 'P17')]","['Oman (/oʊˈmɑːn/ oh-MAAN; Arabic: عمان ʻUmān [ˈuːmaːn]), officially the Sultanate of Oman (Arabic: سلطنة عُمان Salṭanat ʻUmān), is an Arab country in the southeastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula.', 'Holding a strategically important position at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, the nation is bordered by the United Arab Emirates to the northwest, Saudi Arabia to the west, and Yemen to the southwest, and shares marine borders with Iran and Pakistan.', 'The coast is formed by the Arabian Sea on the southeast and the Gulf of Oman on the northeast.', ""The Madha and Musandam exclaves are surrounded by the UAE on their land borders, with the Strait of Hormuz (which it shares with Iran) and Gulf of Oman forming Musandam's coastal boundaries."", 'From the late 17th century, the Omani Sultanate was a powerful empire, vying with Portugal and Britain for influence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean.', 'At its peak in the 19th century, Omani influence or control extended across the Strait of Hormuz to modern-day Iran and Pakistan, and as far south as Zanzibar (today part of Tanzania, also former capital).', 'As its power declined in the 20th century, the sultanate came under the influence of the United Kingdom.', 'Historically, Muscat was the principal trading port of the Persian Gulf region.', 'Muscat was also among the most important trading ports of the Indian Ocean.', ""Oman's official religion is Islam."", 'Oman is an absolute monarchy.', 'The Sultan Qaboos bin Said al Said has been the hereditary leader of the country since 1970.', 'Sultan Qaboos is the longest-serving ruler in the Middle East.', 'Oman has modest oil reserves, ranking 25th globally.', 'Nevertheless, in 2010 the UNDP ranked Oman as the most improved nation in the world in terms of development during the preceding 40 years.', 'A significant portion of its economy is tourism and trade of fish, dates, and certain agricultural produce.', ""This sets it apart from its neighbors' solely oil-dependent economy."", 'Oman is categorized as a high-income economy and ranks as the 59th most peaceful country in the world according to the Global Peace Index.']",18,249,42

It is the sixth-most populous country with a population exceeding 199 million people. It is the 36th largest country in the world in terms of area with an area covering 881,913 km2 (340,509 sq mi). Pakistan has a 1,046-kilometre (650 mi) coastline along the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman in the south and is bordered by India to the east, Afghanistan to the west, Iran to the southwest and China in the far northeast respectively. It is separated from Tajikistan by Afghanistan's narrow Wakhan Corridor in the north, and also shares a maritime border with Oman. The territory that now constitutes Pakistan was previously home to several ancient cultures, including the Mehrgarh of the Neolithic and the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilisation, and was later home to kingdoms ruled by people of different faiths and cultures, including Hindus, Indo-Greeks, Muslims, Turco-Mongols, Afghans and Sikhs. The area has been ruled by numerous empires and dynasties, including the Indian Mauryan Empire, the Persian Achaemenid Empire, Alexander of Macedonia, the Arab Umayyad Caliphate, the Mongol Empire, the Mughal Empire, the Durrani Empire, the Sikh Empire and the British Empire. As a result of the Pakistan Movement led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah and the subcontinent's struggle for independence, Pakistan was created in 1947 as an independent nation for Muslims from the regions in the east and west of the Subcontinent where there was a Muslim majority. Initially a dominion, Pakistan adopted a new constitution in 1956, becoming an Islamic republic. A civil war in 1971 resulted in the secession of East Pakistan as the new country of Bangladesh. Pakistan is a federal parliamentary republic consisting of four provinces and four federal territories. It is an ethnically and linguistically diverse country, with a similar variation in its geography and wildlife. A regional and middle power, Pakistan has the seventh largest standing armed forces in the world and is also a nuclear power as well as a declared nuclear-weapons state, being the only nation in the Muslim world, and the second in South Asia, to have that status. It has a semi-industrialised economy with a well-integrated agriculture sector, its economy is the 26th largest in the world in terms of purchasing power and 45th largest in terms of nominal GDP and is also characterized among the emerging and growth-leading economies of the world. The post-independence history of Pakistan has been characterised by periods of military rule, political instability and conflicts with neighbouring India. The country continues to face challenging problems, including overpopulation, terrorism, poverty, illiteracy, and corruption. Despite these factors it maintains strategic endowments and development potential while it has made substantial progress in reducing poverty giving it the second lowest headcount poverty rate in South Asia. It is ranked 16th on the 2012 Happy Planet Index, while its stock exchange has been among the highest performing in Asia.

"The Philippines (/ˈfɪlᵻpiːnz/; Filipino: Pilipinas [ˌpɪlɪˈpinɐs]), officially known as the Republic of the Philippines (Filipino: Republika ng Pilipinas), is a sovereign island country in Southeast Asia situated in the western Pacific Ocean. It consists of about 7,641 islands that are categorized broadly under three main geographical divisions: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The capital city of the Philippines is Manila and the most populous city is Quezon City; both are part of Metro Manila. To the North of the Philippines across the Luzon Strait lies Taiwan; China and the territories of Hong Kong and Macao lie in the Northwest; Vietnam sits West across the South China Sea; Southwest lie Brunei, Indonesia and Malaysia in the island of Borneo; the Celebes Sea separates it from other islands of Indonesia in the South; while to the Southeast it is bounded by the Philippine Sea, Indonesia and the island-nation of Palau; far East lie the United States territories of Guam the Northern Mariana Islands; small islands of Japan are found in the Northeast. Its location on the Pacific Ring of Fire and close to the equator makes the Philippines prone to earthquakes and typhoons, but also endows it with abundant natural resources and some of the world's greatest biodiversity. At approximately 300,000 square kilometers (115,831 sq mi), the Philippines is the 72nd-largest country in the world. With a population more than 100 million people, the Philippines is the seventh-most populated country in Asia and the 12th most populated country in the world. An additional 12 million Filipinos live overseas, comprising one of the world's largest diasporas. Multiple ethnicities and cultures are found throughout the islands. In prehistoric times, Negritos were some of the archipelago's earliest inhabitants. They were followed by successive waves of Austronesian peoples. Exchanges with Chinese, Malay, Indian, and Islamic states occurred. Then, various nations were established under the rule of Datus, Rajahs, Sultans or Lakans. The arrival of Ferdinand Magellan in Homonhon, Eastern Samar in 1521 marked the beginning of Spanish colonization. In 1543, Spanish explorer Ruy López de Villalobos named the archipelago Las Islas Filipinas in honor of Philip II of Spain. With the arrival of Miguel López de Legazpi from Mexico City, in 1565, the first Spanish settlement in the archipelago was established. The Philippines became part of the Spanish Empire for more than 300 years. This resulted in Roman Catholicism becoming the dominant religion in the country. During this time, Manila became the western hub of the trans-Pacific Manila–Acapulco galleon trade connecting Asia with the Americas. As the 19th century gave way to the 20th, there followed in quick succession the Philippine Revolution, which spawned the short-lived First Philippine Republic, and the Philippine–American War. Aside from the period of Japanese occupation, the United States retained sovereignty over the islands until after World War II, when the Philippines was recognized as an independent nation. Since then, the Philippines has often had a tumultuous experience with democracy, which includes the overthrow of a dictatorship by a nonviolent revolution. The nation's large population and economic potential have led it to be classified as a middle power. It is a founding member of the United Nations, World Trade Organization, Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and the East Asia Summit. It also hosts the headquarters of the Asian Development Bank. The Philippines is considered to be an emerging market and a newly industrialized country, which has an economy transitioning from being one based on agriculture to one based more on services and manufacturing.","[('Philippines', 'island country', 'is a', 'P31'), ('Philippines', 'island country', 'is a', 'P31'), ('Manila', 'Philippines', 'city', 'P131'), ('Manila', 'Philippines', 'city', 'P131'), ('Quezon City', 'Manila', 'city', 'P131'), ('Quezon City', 'Manila', 'city', 'P131'), ('Quezon City', 'Metro Manila', 'city', 'P131'), ('Quezon City', 'Metro Manila', 'city', 'P131'), ('Metro Manila', 'Philippines', 'city', 'P131'), ('Metro Manila', 'Philippines', 'city', 'P131'), ('Luzon Strait', 'Vietnam', 'nation', 'P17'), ('South China Sea', 'Philippines', 'nation', 'P17'), ('South China Sea', 'Taiwan', 'nation', 'P17'), ('South China Sea', 'China', 'nation', 'P17'), ('South China Sea', 'Vietnam', 'nation', 'P17'), ('South China Sea', 'Brunei', 'nation', 'P17'), ('South China Sea', 'Malaysia', 'nation', 'P17'), ('Brunei', 'Borneo', 'island', 'P706'), ('Brunei', 'Borneo', 'island', 'P706'), ('Borneo', 'Brunei', 'nation', 'P17'), ('Borneo', 'Indonesia', 'nation', 'P17'), ('Borneo', 'Malaysia', 'nation', 'P17'), ('Borneo', 'Indonesia', 'nation', 'P17'), ('Borneo', 'Indonesia', 'nation', 'P17'), ('Celebes Sea', 'Indonesia', 'nation', 'P17'), ('Celebes Sea', 'Indonesia', 'nation', 'P17'), ('Celebes Sea', 'Indonesia', 'nation', 'P17'), ('It', 'United Nations', 'member of', 'P463'), ('It', 'World Trade Organization', 'member of', 'P463'), ('It', 'Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation', 'member of', 'P463')]","['The Philippines (/ˈfɪlᵻpiːnz/;

"South Dakota (/ˌsaʊθ dəˈkoʊtə/; locally [ˌsɑʊθ dəˈko̞ɾə]) is a state located in the Midwestern region of the United States. It is named after the Lakota and Dakota Sioux Native American tribes. South Dakota is the 17th most extensive, but the 5th least populous and the 5th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Once the southern portion of the Dakota Territory, South Dakota became a state on November 2, 1889, simultaneously with North Dakota. Pierre is the state capital and Sioux Falls, with a population of about 165,000, is South Dakota's largest city. South Dakota is bordered by the states of North Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska, Wyoming, and Montana. The state is bisected by the Missouri River, dividing South Dakota into two geographically and socially distinct halves, known to residents as ""East River"" and ""West River"". Eastern South Dakota is home to most of the state's population, and fertile soil in this area is used to grow a variety of crops. West of the Missouri, ranching is the predominant agricultural activity, and the economy is more dependent on tourism and defense spending. The Black Hills, a group of low pine-covered mountains sacred to the Sioux, are located in the southwest part of the state. Mount Rushmore, a major tourist destination, is located there. South Dakota experiences a temperate continental climate, with four distinct seasons and precipitation ranging from moderate in the east to semi-arid in the west. The ecology of the state features species typical of a North American grassland biome. Humans have inhabited the area for several millennia, with the Sioux becoming dominant by the early 19th century. In the late 19th century, European-American settlement intensified after a gold rush in the Black Hills and the construction of railroads from the east. Encroaching miners and settlers triggered a number of Indian wars, ending with the Wounded Knee Massacre in 1890. Key events in the 20th century included the Dust Bowl and Great Depression, increased federal spending during the 1940s and 50s for agriculture and defense, and an industrialization of agriculture which has much reduced family farming.

"South Australia (abbreviated as SA) is a state in the southern central part of Australia. It covers some of the most arid parts of the continent. With a total land area of 983,482 square kilometres (379,725 sq mi), it is the fourth largest of Australia's six states. South Australia with a population of 1.7 million is a uniquely highly-centralised state in Australia, with a lack of comparatively-sized rural population centres, and has over 75 percent of the state's population contained in the metropolitan capital of Adelaide with a population of 1.3 million. South Australia shares borders with all of the other mainland states, and with the Northern Territory; it is bordered to the west by Western Australia, to the north by the Northern Territory, to the north-east by Queensland, to the east by New South Wales, to the south-east by Victoria, and to the south by the Great Australian Bight and the Indian Ocean. The state comprises less than 8 percent of the Australian population and ranks fifth in population among the six states and two territories. The majority of its people reside in Adelaide. Most of the remainder are settled in fertile areas along the south-eastern coast and River Murray. The state's colonial origins are unique in Australia as a freely settled, planned British province, rather than as a convict settlement. Official settlement began on 28 December 1836, when the colony was proclaimed at the Old Gum Tree by Governor John Hindmarsh. As with the rest of the continent, the region had been long occupied by the indigenous Aboriginal peoples, who were organised into numerous tribes and languages. The first British settlement to be established was Kingscote, Kangaroo Island, on 26 July 1836, five months before Adelaide was founded. The guiding principle behind settlement was that of systematic colonisation, a theory espoused by Edward Gibbon Wakefield that was later employed by the New Zealand Company.[citation needed] The goal was to establish the province as a centre of civilisation for free immigrants, promising civil liberties and religious tolerance. Although its history is marked by economic hardship, South Australia has remained politically innovative and culturally vibrant. Today, it is known for its fine wine and numerous cultural festivals. The state's economy is dominated by the agricultural, manufacturing and mining industries. The state has an increasingly significant finance sector as well.[citation needed]","[('South Australia', 'Australia', 'state', 'P17'), ('SA', 'Australia', 'state', 'P17'), ('South Australia', 'Northern Territory', 'borders', 'P47'), ('South Australia', 'Western Australia', 'borders', 'P47'), ('South Australia', 'Northern Territory', 'borders', 'P47'), ('South Australia', 'Queensland', 'borders', 'P47'), ('South Australia', 'New South Wales', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Northern Territory', 'South Australia', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Northern Territory', 'Western Australia', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Northern Territory', 'Queensland', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Western Australia', 'South Australia', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Western Australia', 'Northern Territory', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Western Australia', 'Northern Territory', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Northern Territory', 'South Australia', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Northern Territory', 'Western Australia', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Northern Territory', 'Queensland', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Queensland', 'South Australia', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Queensland', 'Northern Territory', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Queensland', 'Northern Territory', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Queensland', 'New South Wales', 'borders', 'P47'), ('New South Wales', 'South Australia', 'borders', 'P47'), ('New South Wales', 'Queensland', 'borders', 'P47')]","['South Australia (abbreviated as SA) is a state in the southern central part of Australia.', 'It covers some of the most arid parts of the continent.', ""With a total land area of 983,482 square kilometres (379,725 sq mi), it is the fourth largest of Australia's six states."", ""South Australia with a population of 1.7 million is a uniquely highly-centralised state in Australia, with a lack of comparatively-sized rural population centres, and has over 75 percent of the state's population contained in the metropolitan capital of Adelaide with a population of 1.3 million."", 'South Australia shares borders with all of the other mainland states, and with the Northern Territory; it is bordered to the west by Western Australia, to the north by the Northern Territory, to the north-east by Queensland, to the east by New South Wales, to the south-east by Victoria, and to the south by the Great Australian Bight and the Indian Ocean.', 'The state comprises less than 8 percent of the Australian population and ranks fifth in population among the six states and two territories.', 'The majority of its people reside in Adelaide.', 'Most of the remainder are settled in fertile areas along the south-eastern coast and River Murray.', ""The state's colonial origins are unique in Australia as a freely settled, planned British province, rather than as a convict settlement."", 'Official settlement began on 28 December 1836, when the colony was proclaimed at the Old Gum Tree by Governor John Hindmarsh.', 'As with the rest of the continent, the region had been long occupied by the indigenous Aboriginal peoples, who were organised into numerous tribes and languages.', 'The first British settlement to be established was Kingscote, Kangaroo Island, on 26 July 1836, five months before Adelaide was founded.', 'The guiding principle behind settlement was that of systematic colonisation, a theory espoused by Edward Gibbon Wakefield that was later employed by the New Zealand Company.', '[citation needed] The goal was to establish the province as a centre of civilisation for free immigrants, promising civil liberties and religious tolerance.', 'Although its history is marked by economic hardship, South Australia has remained politically innovative and culturally vibrant.', 'Today, it is known for its fine wine and numerous cultural festivals.', ""The state's economy is dominated by the agricultural, manufacturing and mining industries."", 'The state has an increasingly significant finance sector as well.', '[citation needed]']",19,356,62

"Sudan (Arabic: السودان as-Sūdān, /suˈdæn/, /suːˈdɑːn/), officially the Republic of the Sudan (Arabic: جمهورية السودان Jumhūrīyat as-Sūdān), is a country in north-east Africa. It is bordered by Egypt to the north, the Red Sea, Eritrea, and Ethiopia, to the east, South Sudan to the south, the Central African Republic to the southwest, Chad to the west and Libya to the northwest. It is the third largest country in Africa. The River Nile divides the country into eastern and western halves. Its predominant religion is Islam. Sudan was home to numerous ancient civilizations, such as the Kingdom of Kush, Kerma, Nobatia, Alodia, Makuria, Meroë and others, most of which flourished along the Nile. During the pre-dynastic period Nubia and Nagadan Upper Egypt were identical, simultaneously evolved systems of pharaonic kingship by 3300 BC. By virtue of its proximity to Egypt, the Sudan participated in the wider history of the Near East inasmuch as it was Christianized by the 6th century, and Islamized in the 15th. As a result of Christianization, the Old Nubian language stands as the oldest recorded Nilo-Saharan language (earliest records dating to the 9th century).Sudan was the largest country in Africa and the Arab world until 2011, when South Sudan separated into an independent country, following an independence referendum. Sudan is now the third largest country in Africa (after Algeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo) and also the third largest country in the Arab world (after Algeria and Saudi Arabia).

"Serbia (/ˈsɜːrbiə/, Serbian: Србија / Srbija, [sř̩bija]), officially the Republic of Serbia (Serbian: Република Србија / Republika Srbija), is a sovereign state situated at the crossroads between Central and Southeast Europe, covering the southern part of the Pannonian Plain and the central Balkans. Serbia is landlocked and borders Hungary to the north; Romania and Bulgaria to the east; Macedonia to the south; and Croatia, Bosnia, and Montenegro to the west; it also claims a border with Albania through the disputed territory of Kosovo. The capital of Serbia, Belgrade, is one of the largest cities in Southeast Europe. Serbia numbers around 7 million residents. Following the Slavic migrations to the Balkans from the 6th century onwards, Serbs established several states in the early Middle Ages. The Serbian Kingdom obtained recognition by Rome and Constantinople in 1217; it reached its peak in 1346 as a relatively short-lived Serbian Empire. By the mid-16th century, the entire territory of modern-day Serbia was annexed by the Ottoman Empire, at times interrupted by the Habsburgs. In the early 19th century, the Serbian Revolution established the nation-state as the region's first constitutional monarchy, which subsequently expanded its territory. Following disastrous casualties in World War I, and subsequent unification of Habsburg crownland of Vojvodina with Serbia, the country co-founded Yugoslavia with other South Slavic peoples, which would exist in various political formations until the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, which had devastating effects for the region. As a result, Serbia formed a union with Montenegro in 1992, which broke apart in 2006, when Serbia again became an independent country. In 2008 the parliament of Kosovo, Serbia's southern province with an Albanian ethnic majority, declared independence, with mixed responses from the international community. Serbia is a member of the UN, CoE, OSCE, PfP, BSEC, and CEFTA. As a membership candidate, Serbia is currently negotiating its EU accession. The country is acceding to the WTO and is a militarily neutral state. Serbia is an upper-middle income economy with dominant service sector, followed by the industrial sector and agriculture.

With an estimated 8 million people in 2013, it is the 98th most populous country and with an area of 143,100 km2 (55,300 sq mi), it is the 96th largest country in the world. It is bordered by Afghanistan to the south, Uzbekistan to the west, Kyrgyzstan to the north, and China to the east. Pakistan lies to the south separated by the narrow Wakhan Corridor. Traditional homelands of Tajik people included present-day Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Uzbekistan. The territory that now constitutes Tajikistan was previously home to several ancient cultures, including the city of Sarazm of the Neolithic and the Bronze Age, and was later home to kingdoms ruled by people of different faiths and cultures, including the Oxus civilization, Andronovo culture, Buddhism, Nestorian Christianity, Zoroastrianism, and Manichaeism. The area has been ruled by numerous empires and dynasties, including the Achaemenid Empire, Sassanian Empire, Hephthalite Empire, Samanid Empire, Mongol Empire, Timurid dynasty, and the Russian Empire. As a result of the breakup of the Soviet Union, Tajikistan became an independent nation in 1991. A civil war was fought almost immediately after independence, lasting from 1992 to 1997.

"Tennessee (/tɛnᵻˈsiː/) (Cherokee: ᏔᎾᏏ, Tanasi) is a state located in the Southeastern United States. Tennessee is the 36th largest and the 17th most populous of the 50 United States. Tennessee is bordered by Kentucky and Virginia to the north, North Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi to the south, and Arkansas and Missouri to the west. The Appalachian Mountains dominate the eastern part of the state, and the Mississippi River forms the state's western border. Tennessee's capital and second largest city is Nashville, which has a population of 601,222. Memphis is the state's largest city, with a population of 653,450. The state of Tennessee is rooted in the Watauga Association, a 1772 frontier pact generally regarded as the first constitutional government west of the Appalachians. What is now Tennessee was initially part of North Carolina, and later part of the Southwest Territory. Tennessee was admitted to the Union as the 16th state on June 1, 1796. Tennessee was the last state to leave the Union and join the Confederacy at the outbreak of the U.S. Civil War in 1861. Occupied by Union forces from 1862, it was the first state to be readmitted to the Union at the end of the war. Tennessee furnished more soldiers for the Confederate Army than any other state, and more soldiers for the Union Army than any other Southern state. Beginning during Reconstruction, it had competitive party politics, but a Democratic takeover in the late 1880s resulted in passage of disfranchisement laws that excluded most blacks and many poor whites from voting. This sharply reduced competition in politics in the state until after passage of civil rights legislation in the mid-20th century. In the 20th century, Tennessee transitioned from an agrarian economy to a more diversified economy, aided by massive federal investment in the Tennessee Valley Authority and, in the early 1940s, the city of Oak Ridge. This city was established to house the Manhattan Project's uranium enrichment facilities, helping to build the world's first atomic bomb, which was used during World War II. Tennessee has played a critical role in the development of many forms of American popular music, including rock and roll, blues, country, and rockabilly. Beale Street in Memphis is considered by many to be the birthplace of the blues, with musicians such as W.C. Handy performing in its clubs as early as 1909. Memphis is also home to Sun Records, where musicians such as Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, and Charlie Rich began their recording careers, and where rock and roll took shape in the 1950s. The 1927 Victor recording sessions in Bristol generally mark the beginning of the country music genre and the rise of the Grand Ole Opry in the 1930s helped make Nashville the center of the country music recording industry. Three brick-and-mortar museums recognize Tennessee's role in nurturing various forms of popular music: the Memphis Rock N' Soul Museum, the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, and the International Rock-A-Billy Museum in Jackson. Moreover, the Rockabilly Hall of Fame, an online site recognizing the development of rockabilly in which Tennessee played a crucial role, is based in Nashville. Tennessee's major industries include agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism. Poultry, soybeans, and cattle are the state's primary agricultural products, and major manufacturing exports include chemicals, transportation equipment, and electrical equipment. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the nation's most visited national park, is headquartered in the eastern part of the state, and a section of the Appalachian Trail roughly follows the Tennessee-North Carolina border. Other major tourist attractions include the Tennessee Aquarium in Chattanooga; Dollywood in Pigeon Forge; the Parthenon, the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, and Ryman Auditorium in Nashville; the Jack Daniel's Distillery in Lynchburg; and Elvis Presley's Graceland residence and tomb, the Memphis Zoo, and the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis.","[('Tennessee', 'Kentucky', 'bordered

"The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign state in Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another state—the Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-southwest. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of 93,800 square miles (243,000 km2), the UK is the 80th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 64.5 million inhabitants. The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of governance. Its capital city is London, an important global city and financial centre with an urban population of 10,310,000, the fourth-largest in Europe and second-largest in the European Union. The current monarch—since 6 February 1952—is Queen Elizabeth II. The UK consists of four countries: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The latter three have devolved administrations, each with varying powers, based in their capitals, Edinburgh, Cardiff, and Belfast, respectively. The nearby Isle of Man, Bailiwick of Guernsey and Bailiwick of Jersey are not part of the United Kingdom, being Crown dependencies with the British Government responsible for defence and international representation. The relationships among the countries of the United Kingdom have changed over time. Wales was annexed by the Kingdom of England under the Acts of Union of 1536 and 1542. A treaty between England and Scotland resulted in 1707 in a unified Kingdom of Great Britain, which merged in 1801 with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922, five-sixths of Ireland seceded from the country, leaving the present formulation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The UK has fourteen Overseas Territories. These are the remnants of the British Empire which, at its height in the 1920s, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's land mass and was the largest empire in history. British influence can be observed in the language, culture, and legal systems of many of its former colonies. The United Kingdom is a developed country and has the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and tenth-largest economy by purchasing power parity. The UK is considered to have a high-income economy and is categorised as very high in the Human Development Index, currently ranking 14th in the world. It was the world's first industrialised country and the world's foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The UK remains a great power with considerable economic, cultural, military, scientific, and political influence internationally. It is a recognised nuclear weapons state and its military expenditure ranks fifth or sixth in the world. The UK has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since its first session in 1946. It has been a member state of the European Union (EU) and its predecessor, the European Economic Community (EEC), since 1973; it is also a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Council of Europe, the G7 finance ministers, the G7 forum, the G20, NATO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the World Trade Organization (WTO).","[('European Union', 'G20', 'member of', 'P463'), ('European Union', 'World Trade Organization (WTO)', 'member of', 'P463'), ('EU', 'G20', 'member of', 'P463'), ('EU', 'World Trade Organization (WTO)', 'member of', 'P463'), ('Europe', 'G20', 'member of', 'P463'), ('Europe', 'World Trade Organization (WTO)', 'member of', 'P463'), ('G7', 'It', 'state', 'P17'), ('G20', 'European Union', 'member', 'P527'), ('G20', 'European Union', 'member', 'P527'), ('G20', 'EU', 'member', 'P527'), ('G20', 'EU', 'member', 'P527'), ('G20', 'Europe', 'member', 'P527'), ('G20', 'Europe', 'member', 'P527'), ('G20', 'It', 'member', 'P527'), ('G20', 'It', 'member', 'P527'), ('It', 'European Union', 'member of', 'P463'), ('It', 'EU', 'member of', 'P463'), ('It', 'Commonwealth', 'member of', 'P463'), ('It', 'Europe', 'member of', 'P463'), ('It', 'G20', 'member of', 'P463'), ('It', 'NATO', 'member of', 'P463'), ('It', 'OECD', 'member of', 'P463'), ('It', 'World Trade Organization (WTO)', 'member of', 'P463')]","['The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign state in Europe.', 'Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland and many smaller islands.', 'Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another state—the Republic of Ireland.', 'Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-southwest.', 'The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland.', 'With an area of 93,800 square miles (243,000 km2), the UK is the 80th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe.', 'It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 64.5 million inhabitants.', 'The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of governance.', 'Its capital city is London, an important global city and financial centre with an urban population of 10,310,000, the fourth-largest in Europe and second-largest in the European Union.', 'The current monarch—since 6 February 1952—is Queen Elizabeth II.', 'The UK consists of four countries: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.', 'The latter three have devolved administrations, each with varying powers, based in their capitals, Edinburgh, Cardiff, and Belfast, respectively.', 'The nearby Isle of Man, Bailiwick of Guernsey and Bailiwick of Jersey are not part of the United Kingdom, being Crown dependencies with the British Government responsible for defence and international representation.', 'The relationships among the countries of the United Kingdom have changed over time.', 'Wales was annexed by the Kingdom of England under the Acts of Union of 1536 and 1542.', 'A treaty between England and Scotland resulted in 1707 in a unified Kingdom of Great Britain, which merged in 1801 with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.', 'In 1922, five-sixths of Ireland seceded from the country, leaving the present formulation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.', 'The UK has fourteen Overseas Territories.', ""These are the remnants of the British Empire which, at its height in the 1920s, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's land mass and was the largest empire in history."", 'British influence can be observed in the language, culture, and legal systems of many of its former colonies.', ""The United Kingdom is a developed country and has the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and tenth-largest economy by purchasing power parity."", 'The UK is considered to have a high-income economy and is categorised as very high in the Human Development Index, currently ranking 14th in the world.', ""It was the world's first industrialised country and the world's foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries."", 'The UK remains a great power with considerable economic, cultural, military, scientific, and political influence internationally.', 'It is a recognised nuclear weapons state and its military expenditure ranks fifth or sixth in the world.', 'The UK has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since its first session in 1946.', 'It has been a member state of the European Union (EU) and its predecessor, the European Economic Community (EEC), since 1973;

Utah is the 13th-largest, the 31st-most populous, and the 10th-least-densely populated of the 50 United States. Utah has a population of nearly 3 million (Census estimate for July 1, 2015), approximately 80% of whom live along the Wasatch Front, centering on the state capital Salt Lake City. Utah is bordered by Colorado to the east, Wyoming to the northeast, Idaho to the north, Arizona to the south, and Nevada to the west. It also touches a corner of New Mexico in the southeast. Approximately 62% of Utahns are reported to be members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or LDS (Mormons), which greatly influences Utah culture and daily life.

"Uzbekistan (/ʊz.ˈbɛk.ɪ.ˌstæn/, /ʊz.ˌbɛk.ɪ.ˈstɑːn/), officially the Republic of Uzbekistan (Uzbek: Oʻzbekiston Respublikasi/Ўзбекистон Республикаси), is a doubly landlocked country in Central Asia.

Uzbekistan is bordered by five countries: Kazakhstan to the north; Tajikistan to the southeast; Kyrgyzstan to the northeast; Afghanistan to the south; and Turkmenistan to the southwest. Once part of the Turkic Khaganate and later Timurid Empires, the region that today includes the Republic of Uzbekistan was conquered in the early 16th century by Eastern Turkic-speaking nomads. The area was gradually incorporated into the Russian Empire during the 19th century, and in 1924 what is now Uzbekistan became a bordered constituent republic of the Soviet Union, known as the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic (Uzbek SSR).

"Zimbabwe (/zɪmˈbɑːbweɪ/), officially the Republic of Zimbabwe, is a landlocked sovereign state located in southern Africa, between the Zambezi and Limpopo Rivers. It borders South Africa to the south, Botswana to the west, Zambia to the northwest, and Mozambique to the east and northeast. The capital and largest city is Harare. Since the 11th century, present-day Zimbabwe has been the site of several organised states and kingdoms as well as a major route for migration and trade. The British South Africa Company of Cecil Rhodes first demarcated the present territory during the 1890s; it became the self-governing British colony of Southern Rhodesia in 1923. In 1965, the conservative white minority government unilaterally declared independence as Rhodesia. The state endured international isolation and a 15-year guerrilla war with black nationalist forces; this culminated in a peace agreement that established universal enfranchisement and de jure sovereignty in April 1980. The country then rejoined the Commonwealth of Nations (later suspended in 2003), and became a member of the United Nations and the Southern African Development Community (SADC). An ethnically diverse country of roughly 13 million people, Zimbabwe has 16 official languages, with English, Shona, and Ndebele the most commonly used. President Robert Mugabe serves as head of state and government, and as commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Renowned as a champion for the anticolonial cause, Mugabe also has a reputation as an authoritarian figure responsible for Zimbabwe's problematic human rights record and substantial economic decline.

"Palermo ([paˈlɛrmo], Sicilian: Palermu, Latin: Panormus, from Greek: Πάνορμος, Panormos, Arabic: بَلَرْم, Balarm; Phoenician: זִיז, Ziz) is a city in Insular Italy, the capital of both the autonomous region of Sicily and the Province of Palermo. The city is noted for its history, culture, architecture and gastronomy, playing an important role throughout much of its existence; it is over 2,700 years old. Palermo is located in the northwest of the island of Sicily, right by the Gulf of Palermo in the Tyrrhenian Sea. The city was founded in 734 BC by the Phoenicians as Ziz ('flower'). Palermo then became a possession of Carthage, before becoming part of the Roman Republic, the Roman Empire and eventually part of the Byzantine Empire, for over a thousand years. The Greeks named the city Panormus meaning 'complete port'. From 831 to 1072 the city was under Arab rule during the Emirate of Sicily when the city first became a capital. The Arabs shifted the Greek name into Balarm, the root for Palermo's present-day name. Following the Norman reconquest, Palermo became the capital of a new kingdom (from 1130 to 1816), the Kingdom of Sicily and the capital of the Holy Roman Empire under Frederick II Holy Roman Emperor and Conrad IV of Germany, King of the Romans. Eventually Sicily would be united with the Kingdom of Naples to form the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies until the Italian unification of 1860. The population of Palermo urban area is estimated by Eurostat to be 855,285, while its metropolitan area is the fifth most populated in Italy with around 1.2 million people. In the central area, the city has a population of around 676,000 people. The inhabitants are known as Palermitani or, poetically, panormiti. The languages spoken by its inhabitants are the Italian language, Sicilian language, and the Palermitano dialect. Palermo is Sicily's cultural, economic and touristic capital. It is a city rich in history, culture, art, music and food. Numerous tourists are attracted to the city for its good Mediterranean weather, its renowned gastronomy and restaurants, its Romanesque, Gothic and Baroque churches, palaces and buildings, and its nightlife and music. Palermo is the main Sicilian industrial and commercial center: the main industrial sectors include tourism, services, commerce and agriculture. Palermo currently has an international airport, and a significant underground economy.[citation needed]In fact, for cultural, artistic and economic reasons, Palermo was one of the largest cities in the Mediterranean and is now among the top tourist destinations in both Italy and Europe. The city is also going through careful redevelopment, preparing to become one of the major cities of the Euro-Mediterranean area. Roman Catholicism is highly important in Palermitano culture. The Patron Saint of Palermo is Santa Rosalia whose Feast Day is celebrated on July 15th. The area attracts significant numbers of tourists each year and is widely known for its colourful fruit, vegetable and fish market at the heart of Palermo, known as the Vucciria.","[('Palermo', 'Sicilian', 'capital of', 'P1376'), ('Palermo', 'Sicily', 'capital of', 'P1376'), ('Sicilian', 'Palermo', 'capital', 'P36'), ('Sicilian', 'Panormus', 'capital', 'P36'), ('Sicilian', 'Palermo', 'capital', 'P36'), ('Panormus', 'Sicilian', 'capital of', 'P1376'), ('Panormus', 'Sicily', 'capital of', 'P1376'), ('Sicily', 'Palermo', 'capital', 'P36'), ('Sicily', 'Panormus', 'capital', 'P36'), ('Sicily', 'Palermo', 'capital', 'P36'), ('Palermo', 'Sicilian', 'capital of', 'P1376'), ('Palermo', 'Sicily', 'capital of', 'P1376'), ('Palermo', 'Sicily', 'is located in', 'P131'), ('Palermo', 'Sicily', 'is located in', 'P131'), ('Palermo', 'Sicily', 'capital of', 'P1376'), ('Palermo', 'Sicily', 'capital of', 'P1376'), ('Sicily', 'Palermo', 'capital', 'P36'), ('Sicily', 'Palermo', 'capital', 'P36'), ('Sicily', 'Palermo', 'capital', 'P36'), ('Sicily', 'Palermo', 'capital', 'P36'), ('Sicily', 'Palermo', 'capital', 'P36')]","['Palermo ([paˈlɛrmo], Sicilian: Palermu, Latin: Panormus, from Greek: Πάνορμος, Panormos, Arabic: بَلَرْم, Balarm; Phoenician: זִיז, Ziz) is a city in Insular Italy, the capital of both the autonomous region of Sicily and the Province of Palermo.', 'The city is noted for its history, culture, architecture and gastronomy, playing an important role throughout much of its existence; it is over 2,700 years old.', 'Palermo is located in the northwest of the island of Sicily, right by the Gulf of Palermo in the Tyrrhenian Sea.', ""The city was founded in 734 BC by the Phoenicians as Ziz ('flower')."", 'Palermo then became a possession of Carthage, before becoming part of the Roman Republic, the Roman Empire and eventually part of the Byzantine Empire, for over a thousand years.', ""The Greeks named the city Panormus meaning 'complete port'."", 'From 831 to 1072 the city was under Arab rule during the Emirate of Sicily when the city first became a capital.', ""The Arabs shifted the Greek name into Balarm, the root for Palermo's present-day name."", 'Following the Norman reconquest, Palermo became the capital of a new kingdom (from 1130 to 1816), the Kingdom of Sicily and the capital of the Holy Roman Empire under Frederick II Holy Roman Emperor and Conrad IV of Germany, King of the Romans.', 'Eventually Sicily would be united with the Kingdom of Naples to form the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies until the Italian unification of 1860.', 'The population of Palermo urban area is estimated by Eurostat to be 855,285, while its metropolitan area is the fifth most populated in Italy with around 1.2 million people.', 'In the central area, the city has a population of around 676,000 people.', 'The inhabitants are known as Palermitani or, poetically, panormiti.', 'The languages spoken by its inhabitants are the Italian language, Sicilian language, and the Palermitano dialect.', ""Palermo is Sicily's cultural, economic and touristic capital."", 'It is a city rich in history, culture, art, music and food.', 'Numerous tourists are attracted to the city for its good Mediterranean weather, its renowned gastronomy and restaurants, its Romanesque, Gothic and Baroque churches, palaces and buildings, and its nightlife and music.', 'Palermo is the main Sicilian industrial and commercial center: the main industrial sectors include tourism, services, commerce and agriculture.', 'Palermo currently has an international airport, and a significant underground economy.', '[citation needed]In fact, for cultural, artistic and economic reasons, Palermo was one of the largest cities in the Mediterranean and is now among the top tourist destinations in both Italy and Europe.', 'The city is also going through careful redevelopment, preparing to become one of the major cities of the Euro-Mediterranean area.', 'Roman Catholicism is highly important in Palermitano culture.', 'The Patron Saint of Palermo is Santa Rosalia whose Feast Day is celebrated on July 15th.', 'The area attracts significant numbers of tourists each year and is widely known for its colourful fruit, vegetable and fish market at the heart of Palermo, known as the Vucciria.']",24,245,43
"Anjou ([ɑ̃ʒu]; Latin: Andegavia) is a former French county (in that it was ruled by a count, from c. 880), duchy (1360), and province. Its capital was the city of Angers in the lower Loire Valley. The territory has no very clear geographical borders but instead owes its territory and prominence to the fortunes of its various rulers. Henry ""Curtmantle"", count of Anjou, inherited the kingdom of England on October 25, 1154, becoming Henry II. The resulting Angevin Empire would, at its peak, spread from Ulster to the Pyrenees. Henry's son Richard I had no legitimate issue upon his death, so in 1199 Anjou passed to his nephew, Arthur of Brittany (the posthumous son of Henry II’s fourth son Geoffrey), while the Crown of England passed to Henry II’s fifth son and Richard’s youngest brother, John. Count Arthur was taken prisoner by his uncle the king in 1203 and disappeared under suspicious circumstances. In 1205, the county was seized by Philip II Augustus of France. Its status was elevated to that of a duchy for Prince Louis, the second son of Jean II and remained as such until the Revolution.

"Turin (/tjᵿˈrɪn/ tewr-IN; Italian: Torino, pronounced [toˈriːno]; Piedmontese: Turin, pronounced [tyˈɾiŋ]; Lombard: Türì; Latin: Augusta Taurinorum) is a city and an important business and cultural centre in northern Italy, capital of the Piedmont region, located mainly on the left bank of the Po River, in front of Susa Valley and surrounded by the western Alpine arch and by the Superga Hill. The population of the city proper is 892,649 (August 2015) while the population of the urban area is estimated by Eurostat to be 1.7 million inhabitants. The Turin metropolitan area is estimated by the OECD to have a population of 2.2 million. The city has a rich culture and history, and is known for its numerous art galleries, restaurants, churches, palaces, opera houses, piazzas, parks, gardens, theatres, libraries, museums and other venues. Turin is well known for its renaissance, baroque, rococo, neo-classical, and art nouveau architecture. Much of the city's public squares, castles, gardens and elegant palazzi such as Palazzo Madama, were built in the 16th and 18th century, after the capital of the Duchy of Savoy (later Kingdom of Sardinia) was moved to Turin from Chambery (nowadays France) as part of the urban expansion. Turin is sometimes called the cradle of Italian liberty, for having been the birthplace and home of notable politicians and people who contributed to the Risorgimento, such as Cavour. The city currently hosts some of Italy's best universities, colleges, academies, lycea and gymnasia, such as the six-century-old University of Turin and the Turin Polytechnic. Prestigious and important museums, such as the Museo Egizio and the Mole Antonelliana are also found in the city. Turin's several monuments and sights make it one of the world's top 250 tourist destinations, and the tenth most visited city in Italy in 2008. The city used to be a major European political centre, being Italy's first capital city in 1861 and being home to the House of Savoy, Italy's royal family. Even though much of its political significance and importance had been lost by World War II, it became a major European crossroad for industry, commerce and trade, and currently is one of Italy's main industrial centres, being part of the famous ""industrial triangle"", along with Milan and Genoa. Turin is ranked third in Italy, after Milan and Rome, for economic strength. With a GDP of $58 billion, Turin is the world's 78th richest city by purchasing power, and as of 2010 has been ranked by GaWC as a Gamma- world city. Turin is also home to much of the Italian automotive industry. Turin is well known as the home of the Shroud of Turin, the football teams Juventus F.C. and Torino F.C., the headquarters of automobile manufacturers FIAT, Lancia and Alfa Romeo, Iveco, Case New Holland and as host of the 2006 Winter Olympics and, in the same year, the 37th Chess Olympiad.

"The McLane–Ocampo Treaty, formally the Treaty of Transit and Commerce, was an agreement between the United States and Mexico, signed in the port of Veracruz in Mexico on December 14, 1859, which would have sold the perpetual right of transit to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec to the U.S. for $4 million, through the Mexican ports of Tehuantepec in the south, to Coatzacoalcos in the Gulf of Mexico. All the transit would be free of any charge or duty, both for military and commercial effects and troops. It even granted the obligation of Mexican troops to assist in the enforcement of the rights permanently granted to the U.S. Additionally, it granted rights of passage through two strings of Mexican land: one that would run through the state of Sonora from the port of Guaymas on the Gulf of California, to Nogales, on the border with Arizona; and another one from the western port of Mazatlán, in the state of Sinaloa, going through Monterrey all the way through Matamoros, Tamaulipas, south of present-day Brownsville, Texas, on the Gulf of Mexico. Mexico was also compelled to build storage facilities on either side of the Tehuantepec isthmus. All rights of passage would benefit the U.S. on a perpetual basis. Of the $4 million for the total cost of these benefits, the U.S. would pay immediately only two million to the Mexican government, while the remaining half would stay in U.S. hands in provision for payments to American citizens suing the Mexican government for damages to their rights. Although U.S. President James Buchanan strongly favored the arrangement, and Mexican President Benito Juárez badly needed the money to finance the war he was waging against the Conservative Party, it was never ratified by the U.S. Senate. The fact that the treaty was not ratified by the US Senate is related to the imminent civil war in the US, and the fact that the northern, non-slavery states, that at that time were majority in the senate, were concerned that the provisions in the treaty, in particular the free transit of military effects and troops through the isthmus would benefit the soon to become confederate states, in case of an open war between the union and the confederate states. The U.S. hoped to build a railroad or canal across the isthmus to speed transport of mail and trade goods between the east and west coasts. Roads there and in Nicaragua and Panama already carried considerable traffic. The treaty derives its name from Robert Milligan McLane, then United States ambassador to Mexico, and Liberal politician Melchor Ocampo, who negotiated the treaty in hopes the money would boost the Liberal Party's chances in the ongoing Mexican Reform War. The treaty would also have placed Mexico under the military protection of the U.S. and reduced or eliminated tariffs","[('Sonora', 'Mexican', 'land', 'P17'), ('Sonora', 'Mexican', 'state', 'P17'), ('Sonora', 'Mexican', 'state', 'P17'), ('Sonora', 'Arizona', 'border', 'P47'), ('Sonora', 'Mexico', 'land', 'P17'), ('Sonora', 'Mexico', 'state', 'P17'), ('Sonora', 'Mexico', 'state', 'P17'), ('Guaymas', 'Mexican', 'land', 'P17'), ('Guaymas', 'Mexican', 'state', 'P17'), ('Guaymas', 'Mexican', 'state', 'P17'), ('Guaymas', 'Mexico', 'land', 'P17'), ('Guaymas', 'Mexico', 'state', 'P17'), ('Guaymas', 'Mexico', 'state', 'P17'), ('California', 'Arizona', 'border', 'P47'), ('Arizona', 'Sonora', 'border', 'P47'), ('Arizona', 'California', 'border', 'P47'), ('Sinaloa', 'Mexican', 'land', 'P17'), ('Sinaloa', 'Mexican', 'state', 'P17'), ('Sinaloa', 'Mexican', 'state', 'P17'), ('Sinaloa', 'Mexico', 'land', 'P17'), ('Sinaloa', 'Mexico', 'state', 'P17'), ('Sinaloa', 'Mexico', 'state', 'P17'), ('Monterrey', 'Mexican', 'land', 'P17'), ('Monterrey', 'Mexican', 'state', 'P17'), ('Monterrey', 'Mexican', 'state', 'P17'), ('Monterrey', 'Mexico', 'land', 'P17'), ('Monterrey', 'Mexico', 'state', 'P17'), ('Monterrey', 'Mexico', 'state', 'P17'), ('Matamoros, Tamaulipas', 'Mexican', 'land', 'P17'), ('Matamoros, Tamaulipas', 'Mexican', 'state', 'P17'), ('Matamoros, Tamaulipas', 'Mexican', 'state', 'P17'), ('Matamoros, Tamaulipas', 'Mexico', 'land', 'P17'), ('Matamoros, Tamaulipas', 'Mexico', 'state', 'P17'), ('Matamoros, Tamaulipas', 'Mexico', 'state', 'P17')]","['The McLane–Ocampo Treaty, formally the Treaty of Transit and Commerce, was an agreement between the United States and Mexico, signed in the port of Veracruz in Mexico on December 14, 1859, which would have sold the perpetual right of transit to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec to the U.S. for $4 million, through the Mexican ports of Tehuantepec in the south, to Coatzacoalcos in the Gulf of Mexico.', 'All the transit would be free of any charge or duty, both for military and commercial effects and troops.', 'It even granted the obligation of Mexican troops to assist in the enforcement of the rights permanently granted to the U.S. Additionally, it granted rights of passage through two strings of Mexican land: one that would run through the state of Sonora from the port of Guaymas on the Gulf of California, to Nogales, on the border with Arizona; and another one from the western port of Mazatlán, in the state of Sinaloa, going through Monterrey all the way through Matamoros, Tamaulipas, south of present-day Brownsville, Texas, on the Gulf of Mexico.', 'Mexico was also compelled to build storage facilities on either side of the Tehuantepec isthmus.', 'All rights of passage would benefit the U.S. on a perpetual basis.', 'Of the $4 million for the total cost of these benefits, the U.S. would pay immediately only two million to the Mexican government, while the remaining half would stay in U.S. hands in provision for payments to American citizens suing the Mexican government for damages to their rights.', 'Although U.S. President James Buchanan strongly favored the arrangement, and Mexican President Benito Juárez badly needed the money to finance the war he was waging against the Conservative Party, it was never ratified by the U.S. Senate.', 'The fact that the treaty was not ratified by the US Senate is related to the imminent civil war in the US, and the fact that the northern, non-slavery states, that at that time were majority in the senate, were concerned that the provisions in the treaty, in particular the free transit of military effects and troops through the isthmus would benefit the soon to become confederate states, in case of an open war between the union and the confederate states.', 'The U.S. hoped to build a railroad or canal across the isthmus to speed transport of mail and trade goods between the east and west coasts.', 'Roads there and in Nicaragua and Panama already carried considerable traffic.', ""The treaty derives its name from Robert Milligan McLane, then United States ambassador to Mexico, and Liberal politician Melchor Ocampo, who negotiated the treaty in hopes the money would boost the Liberal Party's chances in the ongoing Mexican Reform War."", 'The treaty would also have placed Mexico under the military protection of the U.S. and reduced or eliminated tariffs']",12,549,92

"The concept of Cascadian bioregionalism is closely identified with the environmental movement. In the early 1970s, the contemporary vision of bioregionalism began to be formed through collaboration between natural scientists, social and environmental activists, artists and writers, community leaders, and back-to-the-landers who worked directly with natural resources. A bioregion is defined in terms of the unique overall pattern of natural characteristics that are found in a specific place. The main features are generally obvious throughout a continuous geographic terrain and include a particular climate, local aspects of seasons, landforms, watersheds, soils, and native plants and animals. People are also counted as an integral aspect of a locale’s life, as can be seen in the ecologically adaptive cultures of early inhabitants, and in the activities of present day reinhabitants who attempt to harmonize in a sustainable way with the place where they live. Cascadian bioregionalism deals with the connected ecological, environmental, economic, and cultural ties that are prevalent throughout the U.S. Pacific Northwest and distance the area from their eastern counterparts. The argument is that those in Washington and Oregon in the United States have much more in common with those in British Columbia, Canada, than those in Washington D.C.. The Cascadia Bioregion is also referred to as the Pacific Northwest Bioregion and encompasses all of the state of Washington, and portions of Oregon, Idaho, California, Nevada, Wyoming, Montana, Alaska, The Yukon Territory, and British Columbia. Bioregions are geographically based areas defined by land or soil composition, watershed, climate, flora, and fauna. The Cascadia Bioregion claims the entire watershed of the Columbia River (as far as the Continental Divide), as well as the Cascade Range from Northern California well into Canada. It's also considered to include the associated ocean and seas and their ecosystems out to the continental slope. The delineation of a bioregion has environmental stewardship as its primary goal, with the belief that political boundaries should match ecological and cultural boundaries. The area from Vancouver, B.C. down to Portland, Oregon has been termed a megaregion by the U.S. and Canadian governments, especially along the ‘Cascadian Corridor’. Megaregions are defined as areas where “boundaries begin to blur, creating a new scale of geography now known as the megaregion. These areas have interlocking economic systems, shared natural resources and ecosystems, and common transportation systems link these population centers together. This area contains 17% of Cascadian land mass, but more than 80% of the Cascadian population. Existing US and Canadian borders continue to be broken down in the face of further economic, political and cultural integration which such programs as the enhanced drivers license program – which can be used to get cross the Canadian border within Washington and British Columbia.","[('Washington', 'United States', 'state', 'P17'), ('Oregon', 'United States', 'state', 'P17'), ('British Columbia', 'Canada', 'state', 'P17'), ('Washington D.C.', 'United States', 'state', 'P17'), ('Washington', 'United States', 'state', 'P17'), ('Oregon', 'United States', 'state', 'P17'), ('Idaho', 'United States', 'state', 'P17'), ('Nevada', 'United States', 'state', 'P17'), ('Wyoming', 'United States', 'state', 'P17'), ('Montana', 'United States', 'state', 'P17'), ('Alaska', 'United States', 'state', 'P17'), ('Yukon Territory', 'Canada', 'state', 'P17'), ('British Columbia', 'Canada', 'state', 'P17'), ('US', 'Canadian', 'border', 'P47'), ('US', 'Canadian', 'borders', 'P47'), ('US', 'Canadian border', 'border', 'P47'), ('US', 'Canadian border', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Canadian', 'US', 'border', 'P47'), ('Canadian', 'US', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Canadian border', 'US', 'border', 'P47'), ('Canadian border', 'US', 'borders', 'P47')]","['The concept of Cascadian bioregionalism is closely identified with the environmental movement.', 'In the early 1970s, the contemporary vision of bioregionalism began to be formed through collaboration between natural scientists, social and environmental activists, artists and writers, community leaders, and back-to-the-landers who worked directly with natural resources.', 'A bioregion is defined in terms of the unique overall pattern of natural characteristics that are found in a specific place.', 'The main features are generally obvious throughout a continuous geographic terrain and include a particular climate, local aspects of seasons, landforms, watersheds, soils, and native plants and animals.', 'People are also counted as an integral aspect of a locale’s life, as can be seen in the ecologically adaptive cultures of early inhabitants, and in the activities of present day reinhabitants who attempt to harmonize in a sustainable way with the place where they live.', 'Cascadian bioregionalism deals with the connected ecological, environmental, economic, and cultural ties that are prevalent throughout the U.S. Pacific Northwest and distance the area from their eastern counterparts.', 'The argument is that those in Washington and Oregon in the United States have much more in common with those in British Columbia, Canada, than those in Washington D.C..', 'The Cascadia Bioregion is also referred to as the Pacific Northwest Bioregion and encompasses all of the state of Washington, and portions of Oregon, Idaho, California, Nevada, Wyoming, Montana, Alaska, The Yukon Territory, and British Columbia.', 'Bioregions are geographically based areas defined by land or soil composition, watershed, climate, flora, and fauna.', 'The Cascadia Bioregion claims the entire watershed of the Columbia River (as far as the Continental Divide), as well as the Cascade Range from Northern California well into Canada.', ""It's also considered to include the associated ocean and seas and their ecosystems out to the continental slope."", 'The delineation of a bioregion has environmental stewardship as its primary goal, with the belief that political boundaries should match ecological and cultural boundaries.', 'The area from Vancouver, B.C.', 'down to Portland, Oregon has been termed a megaregion by the U.S. and Canadian governments, especially along the ‘Cascadian Corridor’.', 'Megaregions are defined as areas where “boundaries begin to blur, creating a new scale of geography now known as the megaregion.', 'These areas have interlocking economic systems, shared natural resources and ecosystems, and common transportation systems link these population centers together.', 'This area contains 17% of Cascadian land mass, but more than 80% of the Cascadian population.', 'Existing US and Canadian borders continue to be broken down in the face of further economic, political and cultural integration which such programs as the enhanced drivers license program – which can be used to get cross the Canadian border within Washington and British Columbia.']",18,280,46
"Kodi (formerly XBMC) is a free and open-source media player software application developed by the XBMC Foundation, a non-profit technology consortium. Kodi is available for multiple operating systems and hardware platforms, with a software 10-foot user interface for use with televisions and remote controls. It allows users to play and view most streaming media, such as videos, music, podcasts, and videos from the internet, as well as all common digital media files from local and network storage media. It is a popular multi-platform alternative to Windows Media Center for HTPC (home theater PC) use. Kodi is highly customizable: a variety of skins can change its appearance, and various plug-ins allow users to access streaming media content via online services such as Amazon Prime Instant Video, Crackle, Pandora Internet Radio, Rhapsody Spotify, and YouTube. The later versions also have PVR (personal video recorder) graphical front end for receiving live television with electronic program guide (EPG) and high-definition digital video recorder (DVR) support. The software was originally produced as an independently developed (homebrew) media player application named Xbox Media Center (abbreviated as XBMC) for the first-generation Xbox game console, and was later made available under the name Kodi (formerly XBMC) as a native application for Android, Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, iOS, and Microsoft Windows based operating systems. It is also available as a standalone version referred to as Kodibuntu. Because of its open source and cross-platform nature, with its core code written in C++ (ANSI standard), modified versions of Kodi/XBMC together with a JeOS have been used as a software appliance suite or software framework in a variety of devices including smart TVs, set-top boxes, digital signage, hotel television systems, network connected media players and embedded systems based on armhf platform like Raspberry Pi. Derivative applications such as MediaPortal, Plex, ToFu, Voddler, and Horizon TV have all initially been spun off from XBMC.

"The Maritsa, Meriç or Evros(Bulgarian: Марица, Maritsa; Ancient Greek: Ἕβρος, Hébros; Modern Greek: Έβρος Evros; Latin: Hebrus or Hebrus, Romanized Thracian: Evgos or Ebros; Turkish: Meriç) is, with a length of 480 km, the longest river that runs solely in the interior of the Balkans. It has its origin in the Rila Mountains in Western Bulgaria, flowing southeast between the Balkan and Rhodope Mountains, past Plovdiv and Parvomay (where the Mechka and the Kayaliyka join it) to Edirne, Turkey. East of Svilengrad, Bulgaria, the river flows eastwards, forming the border between Bulgaria (on the north bank) and Greece (on the south bank), and then between Turkey and Greece. At Edirne, the river flows through Turkish territory on both banks, then turns towards the south and forms the border between Greece on the west bank and Turkey on the east bank to the Aegean Sea. Turkey was given a small sector on the west bank opposite the city of Edirne. The river enters the Aegean Sea near Enez, where it forms a delta. The Tundzha is its chief tributary; the Arda is another one. The lower course of the Maritsa/Evros forms part of the Bulgarian-Greek border and most of the Greek-Turkish border. The upper Maritsa valley is a principal east-west route in Bulgaria. The unnavigable river is used for power production and irrigation. The places that the river flows through include Pazardzhik, Plovdiv, (next to) Parvomay, through Dimitrovgrad and Svilengrad in Bulgaria, Edirne in Turkey and Kastanies, Pythio, Didymoteicho and Lavara in Greece.

"Guatemala (/ˌɡwɑːtᵻˈmɑːləˌ ɡwæ-ˌ ɡɑː-/ GWAH-tə-MAH-lə, GWAT-ə-MAH-lə or GAH-tə-MAH-lə; [gwateˈmala]), officially the Republic of Guatemala (Spanish: República de Guatemala), is a country in Central America bordered by Mexico to the north and west, the Pacific Ocean to the southwest, Belize to the northeast, the Caribbean to the east, Honduras to the east and El Salvador to the southeast. With an estimated population of around 15.8 million, it is the most populous state in Central America. A representative democracy, Guatemala's capital and largest city is Nueva Guatemala de la Asunción, also known as Guatemala City. The territory of modern Guatemala once formed the core of the Mayan civilization, which extended across Mesoamerica. Most of the country was conquered by the Spanish in the 16th century, becoming part of the viceroyalty of New Spain. Guatemala attained independence in 1821 as part of the Federal Republic of Central America, which dissolved in 1841. From the mid to late 19th century, Guatemala experienced chronic instability and civil strife. Beginning in the early 20th century, it was ruled by a series of dictators backed by the United Fruit Company and the United States government. In 1944, authoritarian leader Jorge Ubico was overthrown by a pro-democratic military coup, initiating a decade-long revolution that led to sweeping social and economic reforms. A U.S.-backed military coup in 1954 ended the revolution and installed a dictatorship. From 1960 to 1996, Guatemala endured a bloody civil war fought between the U.S.-backed government and leftist rebels, which included massacres of the Mayan population perpetrated by the military.

"Noise music is a category of music that is characterised by the expressive use of noise within a musical context. This type of music tends to challenge the distinction that is made in conventional musical practices between musical and non-musical sound. Noise music includes a wide range of musical styles and sound-based creative practices that feature noise as a primary aspect. It can feature acoustically or electronically generated noise, and both traditional and unconventional musical instruments. It may incorporate live machine sounds, non-musical vocal techniques, physically manipulated audio media, processed sound recordings, field recording, computer-generated noise, stochastic process, and other randomly produced electronic signals such as distortion, feedback, static, hiss and hum. There may also be emphasis on high volume levels and lengthy, continuous pieces. More generally noise music may contain aspects such as improvisation, extended technique, cacophony and indeterminacy, and in many instances conventional use of melody, harmony, rhythm and pulse is dispensed with. The Futurist art movement was important for the development of the noise aesthetic, as was the Dada art movement (a prime example being the Antisymphony concert performed on April 30, 1919 in Berlin), and later the Surrealist and Fluxus art movements, specifically the Fluxus artists Joe Jones, Yasunao Tone, George Brecht, Robert Watts, Wolf Vostell, Dieter Roth, Yoko Ono, Nam June Paik, Walter De Maria's Ocean Music, Milan Knížák's Broken Music Composition, early LaMonte Young and Takehisa Kosugi. Contemporary noise music is often associated with extreme volume and distortion. In the domain of experimental rock, examples include Jimi Hendrix's use of feedback, Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music, and Sonic Youth. Other examples of music that contain noise-based features include works by Iannis Xenakis, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Helmut Lachenmann, Cornelius Cardew, Theatre of Eternal Music, Glenn Branca, Rhys Chatham, Ryoji Ikeda, Survival Research Laboratories, Whitehouse, Ramleh , Coil, Brighter Death Now, Merzbow, Cabaret Voltaire, Psychic TV, Blackhouse, Jean Tinguely's recordings of his sound sculpture (specifically Bascule VII), the music of Hermann Nitsch's Orgien Mysterien Theater, and La Monte Young's bowed gong works from the late 1960s.

"Chita Oblast (Russian: Чити́нская о́бласть, Chitinskaya oblast; [tɕɪˈtʲinskəjə ˈobləsʲtʲ]) was a federal subject of Russia (an oblast) in southeast Siberia, Russia. Its administrative center was the city of Chita. It had extensive international borders with China (998 km) and Mongolia (868 km) and internal borders with Irkutsk and Amur Oblasts, as well as with the Buryat and the Sakha Republics. Its area was 431,500 square kilometers (166,600 sq mi). Population: 1,155,346 (2002 Census); 1,377,975 (1989 Census). The oblast was established on September 26, 1937. On March 1, 2008, Chita Oblast merged with Agin-Buryat Autonomous Okrug to form Zabaykalsky Krai. The territory that made up the former Chita Oblast was first explored by Cossacks led by Pyotr Beketov in 1653. People began to move into and develop the area in order to strengthen Russia's border with China and Mongolia, extract mineral resources, and build the Trans-Siberian Railway. In 1920, Chita became the capital of the Far East Republic, which merged with Russia in November 1922, a month before the Soviet Union was constituted. In 1923, Chita Oblast was formed. The oblast was rich in ferrous, non-ferrous, rare, and precious metals, coal, charcoal, and mineral waters. Russia's estimated reserves of ores with a high uranium content are 145,400 tons. Most of these deposits are located in the former Chita Oblast, near Krasnokamensk, site of the Priargunsky Mining and Chemical Combine (PMCC). Forests cover about 60% of its territory.

"Lakshmi (Sanskrit:लक्ष्मी, lakṣmī, ˈləkʂmiː) is the Hindu goddess of wealth, fortune, and prosperity (both material and spiritual). She is the wife and active energy of Lord Vishnu.[non-primary source needed] Her four hands represent the four goals of human life considered important to the Hindu way of life – dharma, kāma, artha, and moksha. Representations of Lakshmi are also found in Jain monuments. In Buddhist sects of Tibet, Nepal, and southeast Asia, goddess Vasudhara mirrors the characteristics and attributes of the Hindu goddess Lakshmi with minor iconographic differences. Lakshmi is also called Sri or Thirumagal because she is endowed with six auspicious and divine strength even to Vishnu. When Vishnu descended on the Earth as the avatars Rama and Krishna, Lakshmi descended as his respective consorts: Sita (Rama's wife) and Rukmini (Krishna's wife). In the ancient scriptures of India, all women are declared to be embodiments of Lakshmi.

"The Zambezi (also spelled Zambeze and Zambesi) is the fourth-longest river in Africa, the longest east flowing river in Africa and the largest flowing into the Indian Ocean from Africa. The area of its basin is 1,390,000 square kilometres (540,000 sq mi), slightly less than half that of the Nile. The 2,574-kilometre-long river (1,599 mi) rises in Zambia and flows through eastern Angola, along the eastern border of Namibia and the northern border of Botswana, then along the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe to Mozambique, where it crosses the country to empty into the Indian Ocean.

"Berkshire (/ˈbɑːrkʃər/ or /ˈbɑːrkʃɪər/, abbreviated Berks) is a county of south east England, located to the west of London. It has also been known as the Royal County of Berkshire since at least the 19th century because of the presence of Windsor Castle and was recognised as such by the Queen in 1957 and letters patent issued in 1974. Berkshire is a county of historic origin and is both a ceremonial county and a non-metropolitan county without a county council. Berkshire County Council was the main county governance from 1889 to 1998 except for the separately administered County Borough of Reading. In 1974, significant alterations were made to the county's administrative boundaries although the traditional boundaries of Berkshire were not changed. The towns of Abingdon, Didcot and Wantage were transferred to Oxfordshire, Slough was gained from Buckinghamshire and the separate administration of Reading was ended. Since 1998, Berkshire has been governed by the six unitary authorities of Bracknell Forest, Reading, Slough, West Berkshire, Windsor and Maidenhead and Wokingham.

"Arnold Schoenberg or Schönberg ([ˈaːʁnɔlt ˈʃøːnbɛʁk]; 13 September 1874 – 13 July 1951) was an Austrian composer and painter. He was associated with the expressionist movement in German poetry and art, and leader of the Second Viennese School. With the rise of the Nazi Party, by 1938 Schoenberg's works were labelled as degenerate music because he was Jewish (); he moved to the United States in 1934. Schoenberg's approach, both in terms of harmony and development, has been one of the most influential of 20th-century musical thought. Many European and American composers from at least three generations have consciously extended his thinking, whereas others have passionately reacted against it. Schoenberg was known early in his career for simultaneously extending the traditionally opposed German Romantic styles of Brahms and Wagner. Later, his name would come to personify innovations in atonality (although Schoenberg himself detested that term) that would become the most polemical feature of 20th-century art music. In the 1920s, Schoenberg developed the twelve-tone technique, an influential compositional method of manipulating an ordered series of all twelve notes in the chromatic scale. He also coined the term developing variation and was the first modern composer to embrace ways of developing motifs without resorting to the dominance of a centralized melodic idea. Schoenberg was also a painter, an important music theorist, and an influential teacher of composition; his students included Alban Berg, Anton Webern, Hanns Eisler, Egon Wellesz, and later John Cage, Lou Harrison, Earl Kim, Leon Kirchner, and other prominent musicians. Many of Schoenberg's practices, including the formalization of compositional method and his habit of openly inviting audiences to think analytically, are echoed in avant-garde musical thought throughout the 20th century. His often polemical views of music history and aesthetics were crucial to many significant 20th-century musicologists and critics, including Theodor W. Adorno, Charles Rosen and Carl Dahlhaus, as well as the pianists Artur Schnabel, Rudolf Serkin, Eduard Steuermann and Glenn Gould.

"Austria is a small, predominantly mountainous country in Central Europe, approx. between Germany, Italy and Hungary. It has a total area of 83,879 km² (32,385 mi²), about twice the size of Switzerland and slightly smaller than the state of Maine. The landlocked country shares national borders with Switzerland (a non-European Union member state, which it borders for 158 km, or 98 mi) and the principality of Liechtenstein (also a non-EU member state, of which it borders for 34 km or 21 mi) to the west, Germany (801 km or 497 mi) and the Czech Republic (402 km or 249 mi) and Slovakia (105 km or 65 mi) to the north, Hungary to the east (331 km or 205 mi), and Slovenia (299 km or 185 mi) and Italy (404 km or 251 mi) to the south (total: 2,534 km or 1,574 mi). The westernmost third of the somewhat pear-shaped country consists of a narrow corridor between Germany and Italy that is between 32 km (19 mi) and 60 km (37 mi) wide. The rest of Austria lies to the east and has a maximum north–south width of 280 km (173 mi). The country measures almost 600 km (372 mi) in length, extending from Lake Constance (German Bodensee) on the Austrian-Swiss-German border in the west to the Neusiedler See on the Austrian-Hungarian border in the east. The contrast between these two lakes – one in the Alps and the other a typical steppe lake on the westernmost fringe of the Hungarian Plain – illustrates the diversity of Austria's landscape. Seven of Austria's nine provinces have long historical traditions predating the establishment of the Republic of Austria in 1918: Upper Austria, Lower Austria, Styria, Carinthia, Salzburg, Tyrol, and Vorarlberg. The provinces of Burgenland and Vienna were established after World War I. Most of Burgenland had been part of the Kingdom of Hungary, but it had a predominantly German-speaking population and hence became Austrian. Administrative and ideological reasons played a role in the establishment of Vienna as an independent province. Vienna, historically the capital of Lower Austria, was a socialist stronghold, whereas Lower Austria was conservative, and both socialists and conservatives wanted to consolidate their influence in their respective provinces. Each province has a provincial capital with the exception of Vienna, which is a province in its own right in addition to being the federal capital.

There are two references in the Bible to people who bear that name: Some scholars suggest that the two may be, in fact, one person. In 2 Samuel 12:8, God tells David through the prophet Nathan, ""I gave your master's house to you, and your master's wives into your arms."" Jon Levenson suggests that this implies David took Ahinoam from Saul. Levenson goes on to note that Ahinoam is always mentioned before Abigail and that she bears David a son before Abigail does, and concludes from this that ""she was already married to David when the conflict with Nabal erupted."" However, with Jonathan about the same age as, if not older than, David, Ahinoam, the wife of Saul, would be too old to give birth to David's first-born son, Amnon. Another objection is that the marriage of Ahinoam and David occurred during The Civil War between the House of David and the House of Saul.The term ""your master's wives"" would actually imply that David inherited Saul's harems, as was common among the kings of ancient time. Adherents of source criticism suggest that references to a woman called Ahinoam being Saul's wife belong to the account of the republican source of the Books of Samuel, while in the passages ascribed to the monarchial source, the only mention of a woman called Ahinoam is the description of her as a wife of David.","[('Ahinoam', 'David', 'married to', 'P26'), ('Ahinoam', 'David', 'married to', 'P26'), ('Abigail', 'David', 'married to', 'P26'), ('Abigail', 'David', 'married to', 'P26'), ('Abigail', 'Nabal', 'married to', 'P26'), ('David', 'Ahinoam', 'married to', 'P26'), ('David', 'Abigail', 'married to', 'P26'), ('David', 'Abigail', 'married to', 'P26'), ('Abigail', 'David', 'married to', 'P26'), ('Abigail', 'David', 'married to', 'P26'), ('Abigail', 'Nabal', 'married to', 'P26'), ('David', 'Ahinoam', 'married to', 'P26'), ('David', 'Abigail', 'married to', 'P26'), ('David', 'Abigail', 'married to', 'P26'), ('Nabal', 'Abigail', 'married to', 'P26'), ('Nabal', 'Abigail', 'married to', 'P26'), ('David', 'Ahinoam', 'wife', 'P26'), ('David', 'Amnon', 'son', 'P40'), ('Ahinoam', 'David', 'wife', 'P26'), ('Ahinoam', 'Saul', 'wife', 'P26'), ('Ahinoam', 'David', 'wife', 'P26'), ('Ahinoam', 'Amnon', 'son', 'P40'), ('Saul', 'Ahinoam', 'wife', 'P26'), ('David', 'Ahinoam', 'wife', 'P26'), ('David', 'Amnon', 'son', 'P40'), ('Ahinoam', 'Saul', 'wife', 'P26'), ('Ahinoam', 'Saul', 'wife', 'P26'), ('Ahinoam', 'David', 'wife', 'P26'), ('Ahinoam', 'David', 'wife', 'P26'), ('Saul', 'Ahinoam', 'wife', 'P26'), ('Saul', 'Ahinoam', 'wife', 'P26'), ('Saul', 'Ahinoam', 'wife', 'P26'), ('Saul', 'Ahinoam', 'wife', 'P26'), ('Ahinoam', 'Saul', 'wife', 'P26'), ('Ahinoam', 'Saul', 'wife', 'P26'), ('Ahinoam', 'David', 'wife', 'P26'), ('Ahinoam', 'David', 'wife', 'P26'), ('David', 'Ahinoam', 'wife', 'P26'), ('David', 'Ahinoam', 'wife', 'P26'), ('David', 'Ahinoam', 'wife', 'P26'), ('David', 'Ahinoam', 'wife', 'P26')]","['Ahinoam (Hebrew: אחינועם) is a Hebrew name literally meaning brother of pleasantness, thus meaning pleasant.', 'There are two references in the Bible to people who bear that name: Some scholars suggest that the two may be, in fact, one person.', 'In 2 Samuel 12:8, God tells David through the prophet Nathan, ""I gave your master\'s house to you, and your master\'s wives into your arms.""', 'Jon Levenson suggests that this implies David took Ahinoam from Saul.', 'Levenson goes on to note that Ahinoam is always mentioned before Abigail and that she bears David a son before Abigail does, and concludes from this that ""she was already married to David when the conflict with Nabal erupted.""', ""However, with Jonathan about the same age as, if not older than, David, Ahinoam, the wife of Saul, would be too old to give birth to David's first-born son, Amnon."", 'Another objection is that the marriage of Ahinoam and David occurred during The Civil War between the House of David and the House of Saul.The term ""your master\'s wives"" would actually imply that David inherited Saul\'s harems, as was common among the kings of ancient time.', ""Adherents of source criticism suggest that references to a woman called Ahinoam being Saul's wife belong to the account of the republican source of the Books of Samuel, while in the passages ascribed to the monarchial source, the only mention of a woman called Ahinoam is the description of her as a wife of David.""]",8,314,55

Its economical power makes the region the country's premier center for finance and commerce. NCR accounts for 37.2% of the gross domestic product of the Philippines. The region was established in 1975 through Presidential Decree No. 824 in response to the needs to sustain the growing population and for the creation for the center of political power and the seat of the Government of the Philippines.

"The Democratic Republic of the Congo (/ˈkɒŋɡoʊ/; [kɔ̃ɡo]; French: République démocratique du Congo), also known as DR Congo, DRC, DROC, RDC, Congo-Kinshasa, or simply Congo is a country located in Central Africa. From 1971 to 1997 it was named Zaïre. The DRC borders the Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic, and South Sudan to the north; Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and Tanzania to the east; Zambia and Angola to the south; and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. It is the second largest country in Africa by area, the largest in Subsaharan Africa, and the eleventh largest in the world. With a population of over 75 million, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is the most populated officially Francophone country, the fourth most populated nation in Africa and the nineteenth most populated country in the world. The Congolese Civil Wars, which began in 1996, brought about the end of Mobutu Sese Seko's 31-year reign and devastated the country. The wars ultimately involved nine African nations, multiple groups of UN peacekeepers and twenty armed groups, and resulted in the deaths of 5.4 million people. The Democratic Republic of Congo is extremely rich in natural resources, but political instability, a lack of infrastructure, deep rooted corruption, and centuries of both commercial and colonial extraction and exploitation have limited holistic development. Besides the capital, Kinshasa, the other major cities, Lubumbashi and Mbuji-Mayi, are both mining communities. DR Congo's largest export is raw minerals, with China accepting over 50% of DRC's exports in 2012.

"Greater Manchester is a metropolitan county in North West England, with a population of 2.7 million. It encompasses one of the largest metropolitan areas in the United Kingdom and comprises ten metropolitan boroughs: Bolton, Bury, Oldham, Rochdale, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford, Wigan, and the cities of Manchester and Salford. Greater Manchester was created on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972; and designated a City Region on 1 April 2011. Greater Manchester spans 493 square miles (1,277 km2), which roughly covers the territory of the Greater Manchester Built-up Area, the second most populous urban area in the UK. It is landlocked and borders Cheshire (to the south-west and south), Derbyshire (to the south-east), West Yorkshire (to the north-east), Lancashire (to the north) and Merseyside (to the west). There is a mix of high-density urban areas, suburbs, semi-rural and rural locations in Greater Manchester, but land use is mostly urban — the product of concentric urbanisation and industrialisation which occurred mostly during the 19th century when the region flourished as the global centre of the cotton industry. It has a focused central business district, formed by Manchester city centre and the adjoining parts of Salford and Trafford, but Greater Manchester is also a polycentric county with ten metropolitan districts, each of which has at least one major town centre and outlying suburbs. For the 12 years following 1974 the county had a two-tier system of local government; district councils shared power with the Greater Manchester County Council. The county council was abolished in 1986, and so its districts (the metropolitan boroughs) effectively became unitary authority areas. However, the metropolitan county has continued to exist in law and as a geographic frame of reference, and as a ceremonial county, has a Lord Lieutenant and a High Sheriff. Being within the Lancashire county palatine they are appointed by the monarch in their capacity as Duke of Lancaster. Several county-wide services were co-ordinated through the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities up until April 2011, when the Greater Manchester Combined Authority was established as the strategic county-wide authority for Greater Manchester, taking on functions and responsibilities for economic development, regeneration and transport. A further devolution of powers to Greater Manchester is set to take place upon the election of the inaugural Mayor of Greater Manchester scheduled for 2017. Before the creation of the metropolitan county, the name SELNEC was used for the area, taken from the initials of ""South East Lancashire North East Cheshire"". Greater Manchester is an amalgamation of 70 former local government districts from the former administrative counties of Lancashire, Cheshire, the West Riding of Yorkshire and eight independent county boroughs. Since deindustrialisation in the mid-20th century, Greater Manchester has emerged as an exporter of media and digital content, guitar and dance music, and association football.","[('Greater Manchester', 'county', 'is a', 'P31'), ('Greater Manchester', '1 April 1974', 'created', 'P571'), ('Cheshire', 'Derbyshire', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Cheshire', 'Merseyside', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Cheshire', 'It', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Derbyshire', 'Cheshire', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Derbyshire', 'West Yorkshire', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Derbyshire', 'It', 'borders', 'P47'), ('West Yorkshire', 'Derbyshire', 'borders', 'P47'), ('West Yorkshire', 'Lancashire', 'borders', 'P47'), ('West Yorkshire', 'It', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Lancashire', 'West Yorkshire', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Lancashire', 'Merseyside', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Lancashire', 'It', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Merseyside', 'Cheshire', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Merseyside', 'Lancashire', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Merseyside', 'It', 'borders', 'P47'), ('It', 'Cheshire', 'borders', 'P47'), ('It', 'Derbyshire', 'borders', 'P47'), ('It', 'West Yorkshire', 'borders', 'P47'), ('It', 'Lancashire', 'borders', 'P47'), ('It', 'Merseyside', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Salford', 'Greater Manchester', 'city', 'P131'), ('Salford', 'Greater Manchester', 'town', 'P131'), ('Salford', 'It', 'city', 'P131'), ('Salford', 'It', 'town', 'P131'), ('Trafford', 'Greater Manchester', 'city', 'P131'), ('Trafford', 'Greater Manchester', 'town', 'P131'), ('Trafford', 'It', 'city', 'P131'), ('Trafford', 'It', 'town', 'P131'), ('Greater Manchester', 'county', 'is an', 'P31'), ('Cheshire', 'county', 'is an', 'P31')]","['Greater Manchester is a metropolitan county in North West England, with a population of 2.7 million.', 'It encompasses one of the largest metropolitan areas in the United Kingdom and comprises ten metropolitan boroughs: Bolton, Bury, Oldham, Rochdale, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford, Wigan, and the cities of Manchester and Salford.', 'Greater Manchester was created on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972; and designated a City Region on 1 April 2011.', 'Greater Manchester spans 493 square miles (1,277 km2), which roughly covers the territory of the Greater Manchester Built-up Area, the second most populous urban area in the UK.', 'It is landlocked and borders Cheshire (to the south-west and south), Derbyshire (to the south-east), West Yorkshire (to the north-east), Lancashire (to the north) and Merseyside (to the west).', 'There is a mix of high-density urban areas, suburbs, semi-rural and rural locations in Greater Manchester, but land use is mostly urban — the product of concentric urbanisation and industrialisation which occurred mostly during the 19th century when the region flourished as the global centre of the cotton industry.', 'It has a focused central business district, formed by Manchester city centre and the adjoining parts of Salford and Trafford, but Greater Manchester is also a polycentric county with ten metropolitan districts, each of which has at least one major town centre and outlying suburbs.', 'For the 12 years following 1974 the county had a two-tier system of local government; district councils shared power with the Greater Manchester County Council.', 'The county council was abolished in 1986, and so its districts (the metropolitan boroughs) effectively became unitary authority areas.', 'However, the metropolitan county has continued to exist in law and as a geographic frame of reference, and as a ceremonial county, has a Lord Lieutenant and a High Sheriff.', 'Being within the Lancashire county palatine they are appointed by the monarch in their capacity as Duke of Lancaster.', 'Several county-wide services were co-ordinated through the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities up until April 2011, when the Greater Manchester Combined Authority was established as the strategic county-wide authority for Greater Manchester, taking on functions and responsibilities for economic development, regeneration and transport.', 'A further devolution of powers to Greater Manchester is set to take place upon the election of the inaugural Mayor of Greater Manchester scheduled for 2017.', 'Before the creation of the metropolitan county, the name SELNEC was used for the area, taken from the initials of ""South East Lancashire North East Cheshire"".', 'Greater Manchester is an amalgamation of 70 former local government districts from the former administrative counties of Lancashire, Cheshire, the West Riding of Yorkshire and eight independent county boroughs.', 'Since deindustrialisation in the mid-20th century, Greater Manchester has emerged as an exporter of media and digital content, guitar and dance music, and association football.']",16,346,49
"In Greek mythology, Tyro (Ancient Greek: Τυρώ) was the daughter of Salmoneus and married Cretheus, but loved Enipeus. She gave birth to Pelias and Neleus, the twin sons of Poseidon. With Cretheus she had Aeson, Pheres, and Amythaon. Her father, Salmoneus, was the brother of Athamas and Sisyphus. Tyro was married to Cretheus (with whom she had three sons, Aeson, Amythaon, Pheres) but loved Enipeus, a river god. She pursued Enipeus, who refused her advances. One day, Poseidon, filled with lust for Tyro, disguised himself as Enipeus and from their union was born Pelias and Neleus, twin boys. Tyro exposed her sons on a mountain to die, but they were found by a herdsman who raised them as his own. When they reached adulthood, Pelias and Neleus found Tyro and killed her stepmother, Sidero, for having mistreated their mother (Salmoneus married Sidero when Alkidike, his wife and the mother of Tyro, died). Sidero hid in a temple to Hera but Pelias killed her anyway, causing Hera's undying hatred of Pelias – and her glorious patronage of Jason and the Argonauts in their long quest for the Golden Fleece. Pelias' half brother Aeson, the son of Tyro and Cretheus, was the father of Jason. Soon after, Tyro married Sisyphus and had two children.

"In Greek mythology, Perieres (Ancient Greek: Περιήρης) was King of Messene, an ancient polis in southern Peloponnese. His parentage and offspring vary across ancient authors; in most sources, however, he was a son of Aeolus and Enarete, and husband of Gorgophone, daughter of the famous Perseus. According to John Tzetzes, Perieres was a son of Cynortas, King of Sparta, and father of Oebalus, who, in turn, became by Gorgophone father of Tyndareus and Icarius. The Bibliotheca mentions two different versions of Perieres' lineage, without deciding between them: he could be a son of Cynortas, husband of Gorgophone and father of Tyndareus, Icarius, Aphareus and Leucippus, or he could be a son of Aeolus and father of only two sons by Gorgophone, Aphareus and Leucippus. In this case Tyndareus and Icarius, along with Hippocoon and Arene, would be sons of Oebalus, son of another Perieres, son of Cynortas, their mother being the nymph Bateia. Finally, according to Pausanias, Gorgophone, the daughter of Perseus, was one of the first women who married twice. She first married Perieres, King of Messene, son of Aeolus, and had by him sons Leucippus and Aphareus. After Perieres' death she married Oebalus, king of Sparta, son of Cynortas, and had by him Tyndareus, Icarius and Arene.

"In Greek mythology, Oeneus /ˈɛnˌjuːs/ (Ancient Greek: Οἰνεύς, Oineús) was a Calydonian king, son of Porthaon and Euryte, husband of Althaea and father of Deianeira, Meleager, Toxeus, Clymenus, Periphas, Agelaus, Thyreus (or Phereus or Pheres), Gorge, Eurymede, Mothone, Perimede and Melanippe (although Meleager's and Deianeira's fathers could also have been Ares and Dionysus respectively). Oeneus was also the father of Tydeus by Periboea, daughter of Hipponous, though Tydeus was exiled from Aetolia and appears in myths concerning Argos. He introduced winemaking to Aetolia, which he learned from Dionysus. He sent Meleager out to find heroes to kill the Calydonian Boar, which was ravaging Calydon because Oeneus had forgotten to honor Artemis at the harvest ceremonies. So began the Calydonian Hunt during which the boar was killed by Atalanta and Meleager. However, an argument began as to who should take the boar's skin as a prize: Meleager gave it to Atalanta, but two of his maternal uncles, sons of Thestius, wanted the trophy for themselves, claiming that it belonged to them by the right of birth if Meleager did not want it. Meleager, in rage, killed them, which resulted in a war between the Calydonians and the Curetes, in which all of Oeneus' sons, including Meleager, fell. The sons of Oeneus' brother Agrius deposed him but Diomedes, his grandson through Tydeus, put Oeneus back on the Calydonian throne (or the throne passed to Andraemon, husband of Gorge, due to Oeneus' old age). Oeneus either died of natural causes or was killed by the surviving sons of Agrius who laid an ambush against him while Diomedes was transporting him to Peloponessus.

"In Greek mythology, Eurycleia (Greek: Εὐρύκλεια Eurýkleia), or Euryclea (/ˌjʊrɪˈkliːə, ˌjɜːr-/; also known as Antiphata (Ἀντιφάτη) in other traditions), is the daughter of Ops and granddaughter of Peisenor, as well as the wet-nurse of Odysseus. As a girl she was bought by Laertes, Odysseus' father. He treated her as his wife, but she was never his consummated lover so as not to dishonor his real wife, Anticleia. She nursed Telemachus, Odysseus' son. Eurycleia's name means ""broad fame,"" while Anticleia means ""anti-fame."" The tension between the meanings of Eurycleia's name and Anticleia's name reflects the tension between the two pillars of Odysseus' life. He was born to Anticleia, a noble woman, but was nursed (and essentially raised) by Eurycleia, a lower-class maid. Odysseus' fame comes from his role as a noble hero paralleled to his role as an anonymous beggar. His heroism is essential for capturing Troy; his skills as an orator and schemer as well as his strength and skills on the battlefield are instrumental in the success of the Greeks. However, he takes on the role of a beggar not once, but twice. He first appears as a beggar to sneak into Troy and kill unsuspecting Trojan soldiers, and again when he returns home to Ithaca and plans to kill all of Penelope's suitors. In many ways, his role as a beggar, especially when he returns to Ithaca is far more meaningful. His re-entry into his own home after twenty years is arguably the most important moment of his life, perhaps suggesting that his role as a beggar — and his connection with Eurycleia — is what is most important to him. Eurycleia is the only person to recognize him without him first revealing himself (as he did to Telemachus) after he returns home from the Trojan War. After he enters his own house as a guest of Penelope disguised as a beggar, Eurycleia bathes him and recognizes him by a scar just above his knee, which he got from a boar while hunting with his grandfather Autolycus. Odysseus stops her from telling Penelope or anyone else (except Telemachus, who already knows) in the house of his true identity: Gripping her by the throat he says, ""Nanny, d'ye want to destroy me?...not another soul must know. Or...I will not spare even you my nurse, when I kill the other women in this house.""

"In Greek mythology, Jocasta (/dʒoʊˈkæstə/), also known as Jocaste (Greek: Ἰοκάστη Iokaste) or Epicaste (/ˌɛpɪˈkæsti/; Ἐπικάστη Epikaste), was a daughter of Menoeceus, a descendant of the Spartoi, and Queen consort of Thebes, Greece. She was the wife of first Laius, then of their son Oedipus, and both mother and grandmother of Antigone, Eteocles, Polynices and Ismene. She was also sister of Creon and mother-in-law of Haimon. After his abduction and rape of Chrysippus, Laius married Jocasta. Laius received an oracle from Delphi which told him that he must not have a child with his wife, or the child would kill him and marry her; in another version, recorded by Aeschylus, Laius is warned that he can only save the city if he dies childless. One night, Laius became drunk and fathered Oedipus with Jocasta. Jocasta handed the newborn infant over to Laius. Jocasta or Laius pierced and pinned the infant's ankles together. Laius instructed his chief shepherd, a slave who had been born in the palace, to expose the infant on Mount Cithaeron. Laius's shepherd took pity on the infant and gave him to another shepherd in the employ of King Polybus of Corinth. Childless, Polybus and his Queen, Merope (according to Sophocles, or Periboea according to Pseudo-Apollodorus), raised the infant to adulthood. Oedipus grew up in Corinth under the assumption that he was the biological son of Polybus and his wife. Hearing rumors about his parentage, he consulted the Delphic Oracle. Oedipus was informed by the Oracle that he was fated to kill his father and to marry his mother. Fearing for the safety of the only parents known to him, Oedipus fled from Corinth before he could commit these sins. During his travels, Oedipus encountered Laius on the road. After a heated argument regarding right-of-way, Oedipus killed Laius, unknowingly fulfilling the first half of the prophecy. Oedipus continued his journey to Thebes and discovered that the city was being terrorized by the sphinx. Oedipus solved the sphinx's riddle, and the grateful city elected Oedipus as their new king; Oedipus accepted the throne and married Laius' widowed queen Jocasta, fulfilling the second half of the prophecy. Jocasta bore him four children: two girls, Antigone and Ismene, and two boys, Eteocles and Polynices. When his city was struck by a plague, Oedipus learned that it was divine punishment for his patricide and incest. Hearing this news, Jocasta hanged herself. Alternatively, Jocasta endured the burden of disgrace and continued to live in Thebes, committing suicide later after her sons kill one another in a fight for the crown (see Seven Against Thebes). In both traditions Oedipus gouges out his eyes; Sophocles has Oedipus go into exile with his daughter Antigone, but Statius has him residing within Thebes' walls during the war between Eteocles and Polynices.","[('Menoeceus', 'Jocasta', 'daughter', 'P40'), ('Laius', 'Oedipus', 'son', 'P40'), ('Laius', 'She', 'wife', 'P26'), ('Oedipus', 'Antigone', 'son', 'P40'), ('Oedipus', 'Eteocles', 'son', 'P40'), ('Oedipus', 'Polynices', 'son', 'P40'), ('Oedipus', 'Ismene', 'son', 'P40'), ('Oedipus', 'She', 'mother', 'P25'), ('Oedipus', 'She', 'wife', 'P26'), ('Antigone', 'She', 'mother', 'P25'), ('Eteocles', 'She', 'mother', 'P25'), ('Polynices', 'She', 'mother', 'P25'), ('Ismene', 'She', 'mother', 'P25'), ('She', 'Laius', 'wife', 'P26'), ('She', 'Oedipus', 'wife', 'P26'), ('She', 'Oedipus', 'son', 'P40'), ('She', 'Antigone', 'son', 'P40'), ('She', 'Eteocles', 'son', 'P40'), ('She', 'Polynices', 'son', 'P40'), ('She', 'Ismene', 'son', 'P40'), ('Jocasta', 'Antigone', 'children', 'P40'), ('Jocasta', 'Ismene', 'children', 'P40'), ('Jocasta', 'Eteocles', 'children', 'P40'), ('Jocasta', 'Polynices', 'children', 'P40'), ('Oedipus', 'Antigone', 'daughter', 'P40'), ('Oedipus', 'Eteocles', 'daughter', 'P40'), ('Oedipus', 'Polynices', 'daughter', 'P40'), ('Oedipus', 'Antigone', 'daughter', 'P40'), ('Oedipus', 'Eteocles', 'daughter', 'P40'), ('Oedipus', 'Polynices', 'daughter', 'P40')]","['In Greek mythology, Jocasta (/dʒoʊˈkæstə/), also known as Jocaste (Greek: Ἰοκάστη Iokaste) or Epicaste (/ˌɛpɪˈkæsti/; Ἐπικάστη Epikaste), was a daughter of Menoeceus, a descendant of the Spartoi, and Queen consort of Thebes, Greece.', 'She was the wife of first Laius, then of their son Oedipus, and both mother and grandmother of Antigone, Eteocles, Polynices and Ismene.', 'She was also sister of Creon and mother-in-law of Haimon.', 'After his abduction and rape of Chrysippus, Laius married Jocasta.', 'Laius received an oracle from Delphi which told him that he must not have a child with his wife, or the child would kill him and marry her; in another version, recorded by Aeschylus, Laius is warned that he can only save the city if he dies childless.', 'One night, Laius became drunk and fathered Oedipus with Jocasta.', 'Jocasta handed the newborn infant over to Laius.', ""Jocasta or Laius pierced and pinned the infant's ankles together."", 'Laius instructed his chief shepherd, a slave who had been born in the palace, to expose the infant on Mount Cithaeron.', ""Laius's shepherd took pity on the infant and gave him to another shepherd in the employ of King Polybus of Corinth."", 'Childless, Polybus and his Queen, Merope (according to Sophocles, or Periboea according to Pseudo-Apollodorus), raised the infant to adulthood.', 'Oedipus grew up in Corinth under the assumption that he was the biological son of Polybus and his wife.', 'Hearing rumors about his parentage, he consulted the Delphic Oracle.', 'Oedipus was informed by the Oracle that he was fated to kill his father and to marry his mother.', 'Fearing for the safety of the only parents known to him, Oedipus fled from Corinth before he could commit these sins.', 'During his travels, Oedipus encountered Laius on the road.', 'After a heated argument regarding right-of-way, Oedipus killed Laius, unknowingly fulfilling the first half of the prophecy.', 'Oedipus continued his journey to Thebes and discovered that the city was being terrorized by the sphinx.', ""Oedipus solved the sphinx's riddle, and the grateful city elected Oedipus as their new king; Oedipus accepted the throne and married Laius' widowed queen Jocasta, fulfilling the second half of the prophecy."", 'Jocasta bore him four children: two girls, Antigone and Ismene, and two boys, Eteocles and Polynices.', 'When his city was struck by a plague, Oedipus learned that it was divine punishment for his patricide and incest.', 'Hearing this news, Jocasta hanged herself.', 'Alternatively, Jocasta endured the burden of disgrace and continued to live in Thebes, committing suicide later after her sons kill one another in a fight for the crown (see Seven Against Thebes).', ""In both traditions Oedipus gouges out his eyes; Sophocles has Oedipus go into exile with his daughter Antigone, but Statius has him residing within Thebes' walls during the war between Eteocles and Polynices.""]",24,251,48
"Antiochus II Theos (Greek: Ἀντίοχος Β΄ ὁ Θεός; 286–246 BC) was a Greek king of the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire who reigned from 261 to 246 BC. He succeeded his father Antiochus I Soter in the winter of 262–61 BC. He was the younger son of Antiochus I and princess Stratonice, the daughter of Demetrius Poliorcetes. He inherited a state of war with Ptolemaic Egypt, the ""Second Syrian War"", which was fought along the coasts of Asia Minor, and the constant intrigues of petty despots and restless city-states in Asia Minor. Antiochus also made some attempt to get a footing in Thrace. During the war he was given the title Theos (Greek: Θεός, ""God""), being such to the Milesians in slaying the tyrant Timarchus. During the time Antiochus was occupied with the war against Egypt, Andragoras, his satrap in Parthia, proclaimed independence. According to Justin's epitome of Pompeius Trogus, in Bactria, his satrap Diodotus also revolted in 255 BC, and founded the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, which further expanded in India in 180 BC to form the Indo-Greek Kingdom (180–1 BC). Then about 238 BC, Arsaces led a revolt of the Parthians against Andragoras, leading to the foundation of the Parthian Empire. These events would have cut off communications with India. Phylarchus relays current scandals regarding his drunken banquets and liaisons with unsuitable young men. About this time, Antiochus made peace with Ptolemy II Philadelphus, ending the Second Syrian War. Antiochus repudiated his wife Laodice I and exiled her to Ephesus. To seal the treaty, he married Ptolemy's daughter Berenice and received an enormous dowry. During her stay in Ephesus, Laodice I continued numerous intrigues to become queen again. By 246 BC Antiochus had left Berenice and their infant son Antiochus, in Antioch to live again with Laodice I in Asia Minor. Laodice I took the occasion to poison Antiochus while her partisans at Antioch murdered Berenice and their infant son. Antiochus was buried in the Belevi Mausoleum. Laodice I then proclaimed Seleucus II as King. With his cousin-wife Laodice I, Antiochus had two sons: Seleucus II Callinicus, Antiochus Hierax and three daughters: Apama, Stratonice of Cappadocia and Laodice.","[('He', 'Antiochus I', 'father', 'P22'), ('Antiochus I', 'He', 'daughter', 'P40'), ('Antiochus I', 'He', 'son', 'P40'), ('Stratonice', 'He', 'daughter', 'P40'), ('Stratonice', 'He', 'son', 'P40'), ('Demetrius Poliorcetes', 'Stratonice', 'daughter', 'P40'), ('Demetrius Poliorcetes', 'Stratonice', 'son', 'P40'), ('Antiochus', 'Laodice I', 'wife', 'P26'), ('Laodice I', 'Antiochus', 'wife', 'P26'), ('Berenice', 'Ptolemy', 'daughter', 'P40'), ('Laodice I', 'Antiochus', 'wife', 'P26'), ('Laodice I', 'Seleucus II', 'sons', 'P40'), ('Laodice I', 'Seleucus II', 'daughters', 'P40'), ('Laodice I', 'Antiochus Hierax', 'sons', 'P40'), ('Laodice I', 'Antiochus Hierax', 'daughters', 'P40'), ('Antiochus', 'Laodice I', 'wife', 'P26'), ('Antiochus', 'Seleucus II', 'sons', 'P40'), ('Antiochus', 'Seleucus II', 'daughters', 'P40'), ('Antiochus', 'Antiochus Hierax', 'sons', 'P40'), ('Antiochus', 'Antiochus Hierax', 'daughters', 'P40'), ('Antiochus', 'Laodice', 'wife', 'P26'), ('Laodice', 'Antiochus', 'wife', 'P26'), ('Laodice', 'Seleucus II', 'sons', 'P40'), ('Laodice', 'Seleucus II', 'daughters', 'P40'), ('Laodice', 'Antiochus Hierax', 'sons', 'P40'), ('Laodice', 'Antiochus Hierax', 'daughters', 'P40')]","['Antiochus II Theos (Greek: Ἀντίοχος Β΄ ὁ Θεός; 286–246 BC) was a Greek king of the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire who reigned from 261 to 246 BC.', 'He succeeded his father Antiochus I Soter in the winter of 262–61 BC.', 'He was the younger son of Antiochus I and princess Stratonice, the daughter of Demetrius Poliorcetes.', 'He inherited a state of war with Ptolemaic Egypt, the ""Second Syrian War"", which was fought along the coasts of Asia Minor, and the constant intrigues of petty despots and restless city-states in Asia Minor.', 'Antiochus also made some attempt to get a footing in Thrace.', 'During the war he was given the title Theos (Greek: Θεός, ""God""), being such to the Milesians in slaying the tyrant Timarchus.', 'During the time Antiochus was occupied with the war against Egypt, Andragoras, his satrap in Parthia, proclaimed independence.', ""According to Justin's epitome of Pompeius Trogus, in Bactria, his satrap Diodotus also revolted in 255 BC, and founded the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, which further expanded in India in 180 BC to form the Indo-Greek Kingdom (180–1 BC)."", 'Then about 238 BC, Arsaces led a revolt of the Parthians against Andragoras, leading to the foundation of the Parthian Empire.', 'These events would have cut off communications with India.', 'Phylarchus relays current scandals regarding his drunken banquets and liaisons with unsuitable young men.', 'About this time, Antiochus made peace with Ptolemy II Philadelphus, ending the Second Syrian War.', 'Antiochus repudiated his wife Laodice I and exiled her to Ephesus.', ""To seal the treaty, he married Ptolemy's daughter Berenice and received an enormous dowry."", 'During her stay in Ephesus, Laodice I continued numerous intrigues to become queen again.', 'By 246 BC Antiochus had left Berenice and their infant son Antiochus, in Antioch to live again with Laodice I in Asia Minor.', 'Laodice I took the occasion to poison Antiochus while her partisans at Antioch murdered Berenice and their infant son.', 'Antiochus was buried in the Belevi Mausoleum.', 'Laodice I then proclaimed Seleucus II as King.', 'With his cousin-wife Laodice I, Antiochus had two sons: Seleucus II Callinicus, Antiochus Hierax and three daughters: Apama, Stratonice of Cappadocia and Laodice.']",20,231,37
"Chung Ying Street (Chinese: 中英街) is a street on the border between Hong Kong and Shenzhen, Guangdong province, within the border town of Sha Tau Kok (Hong Kong) and Shatoujiao (Shenzhen). One side of the street belongs to Hong Kong and the other belongs to Mainland China. In Cantonese, Chung means China and Ying England or the United Kingdom. The name is a mark of history of the Second Convention of Peking, a treaty that China under the Qing dynasty was forced to lease New Territories to Britain in 1899. The street was a river in 1899. British use the high water mark as the border. The river was too shallow at the section of Sha Tau Kok. It dried before the coming of World War II. The residents on both dried river sides then erected their shops to trade. The dried river then renamed to Chung Hing Street (traditional Chinese: 中興街; simplified Chinese: 中兴街), and later renamed to Chung Ying Street. The town of Sha Tau Kok flourished for that period of time. After World War II, with large influx of refugees from China, the British colonial government decided to close the border and the town fell within the Frontier Closed Area. The border town declined since then. Chung Ying Street was once a famous place for shopping. In the 1990s, when China was still closed to the world, Chinese tourists visited to buy foreign goods, mostly watches, clothing and jewellery. However, the prosperity has declined in the early 21st century, due to a policy allowing most people from Mainland China to apply to visit Hong Kong directly, causing Chung Ying Street to transform into a place for historical sight-seeing.

"M-83 is a state trunkline highway in the Lower Peninsula of the US state of Michigan primarily serving as a link between Interstate 75/US Highway 23 (I-75/US 23) in Birch Run and the Bavarian-themed town of Frankenmuth. M-83 is primarily a north–south trunkline that passes by such landmarks as Bronner's Christmas Wonderland, Zehnder's and the Bavarian Inn before leaving town. The landscape in the remainder of the area is composed of farm fields between Frankenmuth and the northern terminus at M-15 near Richville. Previously, the M-83 designation was used for a highway in the Upper Peninsula between 1919 and 1926. Immediately after that, the moniker was used to supplant the M-31 designation in The Thumb area.

"Afghanistan /æfˈɡænᵻstæn/ (Pashto/Dari: افغانستان, Afġānistān), officially the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, is a landlocked country located within South Asia and Central Asia. It has a population of approximately 32 million, making it the 42nd most populous country in the world. It is bordered by Pakistan in the south and east; Iran in the west; Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan in the north; and China in the far northeast. Its territory covers 652,000 km2 (252,000 sq mi), making it the 41st largest country in the world. Human habitation in Afghanistan dates back to the Middle Paleolithic Era, and the country's strategic location along the Silk Road connected it to the cultures of the Middle East and other parts of Asia. Through the ages the land has been home to various peoples and witnessed numerous military campaigns; notably by Alexander the Great, Muslim Arabs, Mongols, British, Soviet Russians, and in the modern-era by Western powers. The land also served as the source from which the Kushans, Hephthalites, Samanids, Saffarids, Ghaznavids, Ghorids, Khiljis, Mughals, Hotaks, Durranis, and others have risen to form major empires. The political history of the modern state of Afghanistan began with the Hotak and Durrani dynasties in the 18th century. In the late 19th century, Afghanistan became a buffer state in the ""Great Game"" between British India and the Russian Empire. Following the Third Anglo-Afghan War in 1919, King Amanullah unsuccessfully attempted to modernize the country. It remained peaceful during Zahir Shah's forty years of monarchy. A series of coups in the 1970s was followed by a Soviet invasion and a series of civil wars that devastated much of Afghanistan.

"Anatolia (from Greek Ἀνατολή, Anatolḗ — ""east"" or ""(sun)rise""; in modern Turkish: Anadolu), in geography known as Asia Minor (from Greek: Μικρὰ Ἀσία Mīkrá Asía — ""small Asia""; in modern Turkish: Küçük Asya), Asian Turkey, Anatolian peninsula, or Anatolian plateau, is the westernmost protrusion of Asia, which makes up the majority of the Republic of Turkey. The inhabitants of this region predominantly spoke Greek until the region was conquered first by the Seljuk Turks and later by the Ottoman Empire. The region is bounded by the Black Sea to the north, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and the Aegean Sea to the west. The Sea of Marmara forms a connection between the Black and Aegean Seas through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits and separates Anatolia from Thrace on the European mainland.

"Bulgaria (/bʌlˈɡɛəriə/, /bʊlˈ-/; Bulgarian: България, tr. Bǎlgarija, [bɐɫˈɡarijɐ]), officially the Republic of Bulgaria (Bulgarian: Република България, tr. Republika Bǎlgarija), is a country in southeastern Europe. It is bordered by Romania to the north, Serbia and Macedonia to the west, Greece and Turkey to the south, and the Black Sea to the east. With a territory of 110,994 square kilometres (42,855 sq mi), Bulgaria is Europe's 16th-largest country. Organised prehistoric cultures began developing on Bulgarian lands during the Neolithic period. Its ancient history saw the presence of the Thracians, Greeks and Romans. The emergence of a unified Bulgarian state dates back to the establishment of the First Bulgarian Empire in 681 AD, which dominated most of the Balkans and functioned as a cultural hub for Slavs during the Middle Ages. With the downfall of the Second Bulgarian Empire in 1396, its territories came under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries. The Russo-Turkish War (1877–78) led to the formation of the Third Bulgarian State. The following years saw several conflicts with its neighbours, which prompted Bulgaria to align with Germany in both world wars. In 1946 it became a one-party socialist state as part of the Soviet-led Eastern Bloc. In December 1989 the ruling Communist Party allowed multi-party elections, which subsequently led to Bulgaria's transition into a democracy and a market-based economy. Bulgaria's population of 7.4 million people is predominantly urbanised and mainly concentrated in the administrative centres of its 28 provinces. Most commercial and cultural activities are centred on the capital and largest city, Sofia. The strongest sectors of the economy are heavy industry, power engineering, and agriculture, all of which rely on local natural resources. The country's current political structure dates to the adoption of a democratic constitution in 1991. Bulgaria is a unitary parliamentary republic with a high degree of political, administrative, and economic centralisation. It is a member of the European Union, NATO, and the Council of Europe; a founding state of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE); and has taken a seat at the UN Security Council three times.","[('Romania', 'Serbia', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Romania', 'It', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Serbia', 'Romania', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Serbia', 'Macedonia', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Serbia', 'It', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Macedonia', 'Serbia', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Macedonia', 'Greece', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Macedonia', 'It', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Greece', 'Macedonia', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Greece', 'Turkey', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Greece', 'It', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Turkey', 'Greece', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Turkey', 'It', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('It', 'Romania', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('It', 'Serbia', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('It', 'Macedonia', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('It', 'Greece', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('It', 'Turkey', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('It', 'European Union', 'member of', 'P463'), ('It', 'NATO', 'member of', 'P463'), ('It', 'Europe', 'member of', 'P463'), ('It', 'Europe', 'member of', 'P463'), ('It', 'OSCE', 'member of', 'P463')]","['Bulgaria (/bʌlˈɡɛəriə/, /bʊlˈ-/; Bulgarian: България, tr.', 'Bǎlgarija, [bɐɫˈɡarijɐ]), officially the Republic of Bulgaria (Bulgarian: Република България, tr.', 'Republika Bǎlgarija), is a country in southeastern Europe.', 'It is bordered by Romania to the north, Serbia and Macedonia to the west, Greece and Turkey to the south, and the Black Sea to the east.', ""With a territory of 110,994 square kilometres (42,855 sq mi), Bulgaria is Europe's 16th-largest country."", 'Organised prehistoric cultures began developing on Bulgarian lands during the Neolithic period.', 'Its ancient history saw the presence of the Thracians, Greeks and Romans.', 'The emergence of a unified Bulgarian state dates back to the establishment of the First Bulgarian Empire in 681 AD, which dominated most of the Balkans and functioned as a cultural hub for Slavs during the Middle Ages.', 'With the downfall of the Second Bulgarian Empire in 1396, its territories came under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries.', 'The Russo-Turkish War (1877–78) led to the formation of the Third Bulgarian State.', 'The following years saw several conflicts with its neighbours, which prompted Bulgaria to align with Germany in both world wars.', 'In 1946 it became a one-party socialist state as part of the Soviet-led Eastern Bloc.', ""In December 1989 the ruling Communist Party allowed multi-party elections, which subsequently led to Bulgaria's transition into a democracy and a market-based economy."", ""Bulgaria's population of 7.4 million people is predominantly urbanised and mainly concentrated in the administrative centres of its 28 provinces."", 'Most commercial and cultural activities are centred on the capital and largest city, Sofia.', 'The strongest sectors of the economy are heavy industry, power engineering, and agriculture, all of which rely on local natural resources.', ""The country's current political structure dates to the adoption of a democratic constitution in 1991."", 'Bulgaria is a unitary parliamentary republic with a high degree of political, administrative, and economic centralisation.', 'It is a member of the European Union, NATO, and the Council of Europe; a founding state of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE); and has taken a seat at the UN Security Council three times.']",19,218,39

This region was referred to as the Slave Coast from as early as the 17th century due to the large number of slaves shipped to the New World during the Trans-Atlantic slave trade. After slavery was abolished, France took over the country and renamed it French Dahomey. In 1960, Dahomey gained full independence from France, and had a tumultuous period with many different democratic governments, many military coups and military governments.

"Brunei (/bruːˈnaɪ/, broo-NYE), officially the Nation of Brunei, the Abode of Peace (Malay: Negara Brunei Darussalam, Jawi: نڬارا بروني دارالسلام, Chinese: 文莱达鲁萨兰国), is a sovereign state located on the north coast of the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia. Apart from its coastline with the South China Sea, the country is completely surrounded by the state of Sarawak, Malaysia. It is separated into two parts by the Sarawak district of Limbang. Brunei is the only sovereign state completely on the island of Borneo; the remainder of the island's territory is divided between the nations of Malaysia and Indonesia. Brunei's population was 408,786 in July 2012. At the peak of the Bruneian Empire, Sultan Bolkiah (reigned 1485–1528) is alleged to have had control over most regions of Borneo, including modern-day Sarawak and Sabah, as well as the Sulu archipelago off the northeast tip of Borneo, Seludong (modern-day Manila), and the islands off the northwest tip of Borneo. The maritime state was visited by Spain's Magellan Expedition in 1521 and fought against Spain in 1578's Castille War. During the 19th century, the Bruneian Empire began to decline. The Sultanate ceded Sarawak (Kuching) to James Brooke and installed him as the White Rajah, and it ceded Sabah to the British North Borneo Chartered Company. In 1888, Brunei became a British protectorate and was assigned a British resident as colonial manager in 1906. After the Japanese occupation during World War II, in 1959 a new constitution was written. In 1962, a small armed rebellion against the monarchy was ended with the help of the British. Brunei gained its independence from the United Kingdom on 1 January 1984. Economic growth during the 1990s and 2000s, with the GDP increasing 56% from 1999 to 2008, transformed Brunei into an industrialised country. It has developed wealth from extensive petroleum and natural gas fields. Brunei has the second-highest Human Development Index among the Southeast Asia nations, after Singapore, and is classified as a ""developed country"". According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Brunei is ranked fifth in the world by gross domestic product per capita at purchasing power parity. The IMF estimated, in 2011, that Brunei was one of two countries (the other being Libya) with a public debt at 0% of the national GDP.

"The Czech Republic (/ˈtʃɛk rᵻˈpʌblɪk/ CHEK-rə-PUB-lik; Czech: Česká republika [ˈt͡ʃɛskaː ˈrɛpuˌblɪka]) is a landlocked country in Central Europe bordered by Germany to the west, Austria to the south, Slovakia to the southeast and Poland to the northeast. The capital and largest city, Prague, has over 1.2 million residents. The Czech Republic includes the historical territories of Bohemia, Moravia, and Czech Silesia. The Czech state was formed in the late 9th century as the Duchy of Bohemia under the Great Moravian Empire. After the fall of the Empire in 907, the centre of power transferred from Moravia to Bohemia under the Přemyslids. In 1004, the duchy was formally recognized as part of the Holy Roman Empire, becoming the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1212, and reaching its greatest territorial extent in the 14th century. The King of Bohemia ruled not only Bohemia itself, but also other lands, which together formed the so-called Crown of Bohemia, and he had a vote in the election of the Holy Roman Emperor. In the Hussite wars of the 15th century driven by the Bohemian Reformation, the kingdom faced economic embargoes and defeated five crusades proclaimed by the leaders of the Roman Catholic Church and organized mainly by the emperor and princes of the Holy Roman Empire. Following the Battle of Mohács in 1526, the whole Crown of Bohemia was gradually integrated into the Habsburg Monarchy alongside the Archduchy of Austria and the Kingdom of Hungary. The Protestant Bohemian Revolt (1618–20) against the Catholic Habsburgs led to the Thirty Years' War, after which the monarchy consolidated its rule, reimposed Catholicism, and adopted a policy of gradual Germanization. With the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the Bohemian Kingdom became part of the Austrian Empire and the Czech language experienced a revival as a consequence of widespread romantic nationalism. In the 19th century, the Czech lands became the industrial powerhouse of the monarchy and were subsequently the core of the Republic of Czechoslovakia, which was formed in 1918 following the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after World War I. Czechoslovakia was occupied by Germany in World War II, and was liberated in 1945 by Soviet and American forces. Most of the German-speaking inhabitants were expelled after the war and thus the country lost its sizeable minority and its bilingual character. The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia won the 1946 elections. Following the 1948 coup d'état, Czechoslovakia became a one-party communist state under Soviet influence. In 1968, increasing dissatisfaction with the regime culminated in a reform movement known as the Prague Spring, which ended in a Soviet-led invasion. Czechoslovakia remained occupied until the 1989 Velvet Revolution, when the communist regime collapsed and a multiparty parliamentary republic was formed. On 1 January 1993, Czechoslovakia peacefully dissolved, with its constituent states becoming the independent states of the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The Czech Republic is a highly developed country with an advanced, high income economy and high living standards. The UNDP ranks the country 15th in inequality-adjusted human development. The Czech Republic also ranks as the 10th most peaceful country, while achieving strong performance in democratic governance. Its capital, Prague, has the lowest unemployment rate in the European Union. It is a member of the United Nations, the European Union, NATO, the OECD, the OSCE, and the Council of Europe.","[('Czech Republic', 'landlocked country', 'is a', 'P31'), ('Czech Republic', 'Austria', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Czech Republic', 'Slovakia', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Czech', 'landlocked country', 'is a', 'P31'), ('Czech', 'Austria', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Czech', 'Slovakia', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Germany', 'Poland', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Austria', 'Czech Republic', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Austria', 'Czech', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Austria', 'landlocked country', 'is a', 'P31'), ('Austria', 'Slovakia', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Slovakia', 'Czech Republic', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Slovakia', 'Czech', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Slovakia', 'landlocked country', 'is a', 'P31'), ('Slovakia', 'Austria', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Bohemia', 'Holy Roman Empire', 'part of', 'P361'), ('Bohemian Kingdom', 'Holy Roman Empire', 'part of', 'P361'), ('It', 'United Nations', 'member of', 'P463'), ('It', 'European Union', 'member of', 'P463'), ('It', 'NATO', 'member of', 'P463'), ('It', 'OECD', 'member of', 'P463'), ('It', 'OSCE', 'member of', 'P463'), ('It', 'Europe', 'member of', 'P463')]","['The Czech Republic (/ˈtʃɛk rᵻˈpʌblɪk/ CHEK-rə-PUB-lik; Czech: Česká republika [ˈt͡ʃɛskaː ˈrɛpuˌblɪka]) is a landlocked country in Central Europe bordered by Germany to the west, Austria to the south, Slovakia to the southeast and Poland to the northeast.', 'The capital and largest city, Prague, has over 1.2 million residents.', 'The Czech Republic includes the historical territories of Bohemia, Moravia, and Czech Silesia.', 'The Czech state was formed in the late 9th century as the Duchy of Bohemia under the Great Moravian Empire.', 'After the fall of the Empire in 907, the centre of power transferred from Moravia to Bohemia under the Přemyslids.', 'In 1004, the duchy was formally recognized as part of the Holy Roman Empire, becoming the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1212, and reaching its greatest territorial extent in the 14th century.', 'The King of Bohemia ruled not only Bohemia itself, but also other lands, which together formed the so-called Crown of Bohemia, and he had a vote in the election of the Holy Roman Emperor.', 'In the Hussite wars of the 15th century driven by the Bohemian Reformation, the kingdom faced economic embargoes and defeated five crusades proclaimed by the leaders of the Roman Catholic Church and organized mainly by the emperor and princes of the Holy Roman Empire.', 'Following the Battle of Mohács in 1526, the whole Crown of Bohemia was gradually integrated into the Habsburg Monarchy alongside the Archduchy of Austria and the Kingdom of Hungary.', ""The Protestant Bohemian Revolt (1618–20) against the Catholic Habsburgs led to the Thirty Years' War, after which the monarchy consolidated its rule, reimposed Catholicism, and adopted a policy of gradual Germanization."", 'With the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the Bohemian Kingdom became part of the Austrian Empire and the Czech language experienced a revival as a consequence of widespread romantic nationalism.', 'In the 19th century, the Czech lands became the industrial powerhouse of the monarchy and were subsequently the core of the Republic of Czechoslovakia, which was formed in 1918 following the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after World War I.

"Cameroon (/ˌkæməˈruːn/; French: Cameroun), officially the Republic of Cameroon (French: République du Cameroun), is a country in West Africa. It is bordered by Nigeria to the west; Chad to the northeast; the Central African Republic to the east; and Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and the Republic of the Congo to the south. Cameroon's coastline lies on the Bight of Bonny, part of the Gulf of Guinea and the Atlantic Ocean. Cameroon is home to more than 200 different linguistic groups. French and English are the official languages. The country is often referred to as ""Africa in miniature"" for its geological and cultural diversity. Natural features include beaches, deserts, mountains, rainforests, and savannas. The highest point at almost 4,100 metres (13,500 ft) is Mount Cameroon in the Southwest Region of the country, and the largest cities in population-terms are Douala on the Wouri river, its economical capital and main seaport, Yaoundé, its political capital, and Garoua. After independence, the newly united nation joined the Commonwealth of Nations, although the vast majority of its territories had previously been a German colony and, after World War I, a French mandate. The country is well known for its native styles of music, particularly makossa and bikutsi, and for its successful national football team. Early inhabitants of the territory included the Sao civilisation around Lake Chad and the Baka hunter-gatherers in the southeastern rainforest. Portuguese explorers reached the coast in the 15th century and named the area Rio dos Camarões (Shrimp River), which became Cameroon in English. Fulani soldiers founded the Adamawa Emirate in the north in the 19th century, and various ethnic groups of the west and northwest established powerful chiefdoms and fondoms. Cameroon became a German colony in 1884 known as Kamerun. After World War I, the territory was divided between France and the United Kingdom as League of Nations mandates. The Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC) political party advocated independence, but was outlawed by France in the 1950s. It waged war on French and UPC militant forces until 1971. In 1960, the French-administered part of Cameroon became independent as the Republic of Cameroun under President Ahmadou Ahidjo. The southern part of British Cameroons merged with it in 1961 to form the Federal Republic of Cameroon. The country was renamed the United Republic of Cameroon in 1972 and the Republic of Cameroon in 1984. Cameroon enjoys relatively high political and social stability. This has permitted the development of agriculture, roads, railways, and large petroleum and timber industries. Nevertheless, large numbers of Cameroonians live in poverty as subsistence farmers. Power lies firmly in the hands of the authoritarian president since 1982, Paul Biya, and his Cameroon People's Democratic Movement party. The English-speaking territories of Cameroon have grown increasingly alienated from the government, and politicians from those regions have called for greater decentralization and even secession (for example: the Southern Cameroons National Council) of the former British-governed territories.","[('Nigeria', 'Chad', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Nigeria', 'It', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Chad', 'Nigeria', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Chad', 'Central African Republic', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Chad', 'It', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Central African Republic', 'Chad', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Central African Republic', 'Congo', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Central African Republic', 'It', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Equatorial Guinea', 'Gabon', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Equatorial Guinea', 'It', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Gabon', 'Equatorial Guinea', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Gabon', 'Congo', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Gabon', 'It', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Congo', 'Central African Republic', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Congo', 'Gabon', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Congo', 'It', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('It', 'Nigeria', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('It', 'Chad', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('It', 'Central African Republic', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('It', 'Equatorial Guinea', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('It', 'Gabon', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('It', 'Congo', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Guinea', 'Atlantic Ocean', 'part of', 'P361')]","['Cameroon (/ˌkæməˈruːn/; French: Cameroun), officially the Republic of Cameroon (French: République du Cameroun), is a country in West Africa.', 'It is bordered by Nigeria to the west; Chad to the northeast; the Central African Republic to the east; and Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and the Republic of the Congo to the south.', ""Cameroon's coastline lies on the Bight of Bonny, part of the Gulf of Guinea and the Atlantic Ocean."", 'Cameroon is home to more than 200 different linguistic groups.', 'French and English are the official languages.', 'The country is often referred to as ""Africa in miniature"" for its geological and cultural diversity.', 'Natural features include beaches, deserts, mountains, rainforests, and savannas.', 'The highest point at almost 4,100 metres (13,500 ft) is Mount Cameroon in the Southwest Region of the country, and the largest cities in population-terms are Douala on the Wouri river, its economical capital and main seaport, Yaoundé, its political capital, and Garoua.', 'After independence, the newly united nation joined the Commonwealth of Nations, although the vast majority of its territories had previously been a German colony and, after World War I, a French mandate.', 'The country is well known for its native styles of music, particularly makossa and bikutsi, and for its successful national football team.', 'Early inhabitants of the territory included the Sao civilisation around Lake Chad and the Baka hunter-gatherers in the southeastern rainforest.', 'Portuguese explorers reached the coast in the 15th century and named the area Rio dos Camarões (Shrimp River), which became Cameroon in English.', 'Fulani soldiers founded the Adamawa Emirate in the north in the 19th century, and various ethnic groups of the west and northwest established powerful chiefdoms and fondoms.', 'Cameroon became a German colony in 1884 known as Kamerun.', 'After World War I, the territory was divided between France and the United Kingdom as League of Nations mandates.', 'The Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC) political party advocated independence, but was outlawed by France in the 1950s.', 'It waged war on French and UPC militant forces until 1971.', 'In 1960, the French-administered part of Cameroon became independent as the Republic of Cameroun under President Ahmadou Ahidjo.', 'The southern part of British Cameroons merged with it in 1961 to form the Federal Republic of Cameroon.', 'The country was renamed the United Republic of Cameroon in 1972 and the Republic of Cameroon in 1984.', 'Cameroon enjoys relatively high political and social stability.', 'This has permitted the development of agriculture, roads, railways, and large petroleum and timber industries.', 'Nevertheless, large numbers of Cameroonians live in poverty as subsistence farmers.', ""Power lies firmly in the hands of the authoritarian president since 1982, Paul Biya, and his Cameroon People's Democratic Movement party."", 'The English-speaking territories of Cameroon have grown increasingly alienated from the government, and politicians from those regions have called for greater decentralization and even secession (for example: the Southern Cameroons National Council) of the former British-governed territories.']",25,293,43
"Chad (/tʃæd/; Arabic: تشاد Tshād; French: Tchad), officially the Republic of Chad (Arabic: جمهورية تشاد Jumhūrīyat Tshād; French: République du Tchad), is a landlocked country in Central Africa. It is bordered by Libya to the north, Sudan to the east, the Central African Republic to the south, Cameroon and Nigeria to the southwest and Niger to the west. It is the fifth largest country in Africa in terms of area. Chad has several regions: a desert zone in the north, an arid Sahelian belt in the centre and a more fertile Sudanian Savanna zone in the south. Lake Chad, after which the country is named, is the largest wetland in Chad and the second-largest in Africa. N'Djamena, the capital, is the largest city. Chad is home to over 200 different ethnic and linguistic groups. Arabic and French are the official languages. Islam and Christianity are the most widely practiced religions. Beginning in the 7th millennium BC, human populations moved into the Chadian basin in great numbers. By the end of the 1st millennium BC, a series of states and empires rose and fell in Chad's Sahelian strip, each focused on controlling the trans-Saharan trade routes that passed through the region. France conquered the territory by 1920 and incorporated it as part of French Equatorial Africa. In 1960, Chad obtained independence under the leadership of François Tombalbaye. Resentment towards his policies in the Muslim north culminated in the eruption of a long-lasting civil war in 1965. In 1979, the rebels conquered the capital and put an end to the south's hegemony. However, the rebel commanders fought amongst themselves until Hissène Habré defeated his rivals. He was overthrown in 1990 by his general Idriss Déby. Since 2003, the Darfur crisis in Sudan has spilt over the border and destabilised the nation, with hundreds of thousands of Sudanese refugees living in and around camps in eastern Chad. While many political parties are active, power lies firmly in the hands of President Déby and his political party, the Patriotic Salvation Movement. Chad remains plagued by political violence and recurrent attempted coups d'état. Chad is one of the poorest and most corrupt countries in the world; most inhabitants live in poverty as subsistence herders and farmers. Since 2003, crude oil has become the country's primary source of export earnings, superseding the traditional cotton industry.","[('Chad', 'landlocked country', 'is a', 'P31'), ('Tchad', 'landlocked country', 'is a', 'P31'), ('Chad', 'landlocked country', 'is a', 'P31'), ('Tchad', 'landlocked country', 'is a', 'P31'), ('Central Africa', 'landlocked country', 'is a', 'P31'), ('Libya', 'Sudan', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Libya', 'Niger', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Libya', 'It', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Sudan', 'Libya', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Sudan', 'Central African Republic', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Sudan', 'It', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Central African Republic', 'Sudan', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Central African Republic', 'Cameroon', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Central African Republic', 'It', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Cameroon', 'Central African Republic', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Cameroon', 'Nigeria', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Cameroon', 'It', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Nigeria', 'Cameroon', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Nigeria', 'Niger', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Nigeria', 'It', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Niger', 'Libya', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Niger', 'Nigeria', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Niger', 'It', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('It', 'Libya', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('It', 'Sudan', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('It', 'Central African Republic', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('It', 'Cameroon', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('It', 'Nigeria', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('It', 'Niger', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Lake Chad', 'Chad', 'country', 'P17')]","['Chad (/tʃæd/; Arabic: تشاد Tshād; French: Tchad), officially the Republic of Chad (Arabic: جمهورية تشاد Jumhūrīyat Tshād; French: République du Tchad), is a landlocked country in Central Africa.', 'It is bordered by Libya to the north, Sudan to the east, the Central African Republic to the south, Cameroon and Nigeria to the southwest and Niger to the west.', 'It is the fifth largest country in Africa in terms of area.', 'Chad has several regions: a desert zone in the north, an arid Sahelian belt in the centre and a more fertile Sudanian Savanna zone in the south.', 'Lake Chad, after which the country is named, is the largest wetland in Chad and the second-largest in Africa.', ""N'Djamena, the capital, is the largest city."", 'Chad is home to over 200 different ethnic and linguistic groups.', 'Arabic and French are the official languages.', 'Islam and Christianity are the most widely practiced religions.', 'Beginning in the 7th millennium BC, human populations moved into the Chadian basin in great numbers.', ""By the end of the 1st millennium BC, a series of states and empires rose and fell in Chad's Sahelian strip, each focused on controlling the trans-Saharan trade routes that passed through the region."", 'France conquered the territory by 1920 and incorporated it as part of French Equatorial Africa.', 'In 1960, Chad obtained independence under the leadership of François Tombalbaye.', 'Resentment towards his policies in the Muslim north culminated in the eruption of a long-lasting civil war in 1965.', ""In 1979, the rebels conquered the capital and put an end to the south's hegemony."", 'However, the rebel commanders fought amongst themselves until Hissène Habré defeated his rivals.', 'He was overthrown in 1990 by his general Idriss Déby.', 'Since 2003, the Darfur crisis in Sudan has spilt over the border and destabilised the nation, with hundreds of thousands of Sudanese refugees living in and around camps in eastern Chad.', 'While many political parties are active, power lies firmly in the hands of President Déby and his political party, the Patriotic Salvation Movement.', ""Chad remains plagued by political violence and recurrent attempted coups d'état."", 'Chad is one of the poorest and most corrupt countries in the world; most inhabitants live in poverty as subsistence herders and farmers.', ""Since 2003, crude oil has become the country's primary source of export earnings, superseding the traditional cotton industry.""]",22,198,34
"Colorado (/kɒləˈrædoʊ/, or /kɒləˈrɑːdoʊ/) (Spanish for ""ruddy"") is a state in the United States encompassing most of the Southern Rocky Mountains as well as the northeastern portion of the Colorado Plateau and the western edge of the Great Plains. Colorado is part of the Western United States, the Southwestern United States, and the Mountain States. Colorado is the 8th most extensive and the 22nd most populous of the 50 United States. The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Colorado was 5,456,574 on July 1, 2015, an increase of 8.50% since the 2010 United States Census. The state was named for the Colorado River, which Spanish travelers named the Río Colorado for the ruddy (Spanish: colorado) silt the river carried from the mountains. The Territory of Colorado was organized on February 28, 1861, and on August 1, 1876, U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant signed Proclamation 230 admitting Colorado to the Union as the 38th state. Colorado is nicknamed the ""Centennial State"" because it became a state 28 days after the centennial of the United States Declaration of Independence. Colorado is bordered by Wyoming to the north, Nebraska to the northeast, Kansas to the east, Oklahoma to the southeast, New Mexico to the south, Utah to the west, and Arizona to the southwest, at the Four Corners. Colorado is noted for its vivid landscape of mountains, forests, high plains, mesas, canyons, plateaus, rivers, and desert lands. Denver is the capital and the most populous city of Colorado.

"Denmark is a Nordic country located in Northern Europe. It consists of the Jutland peninsula and several islands in the Baltic sea, referred to as the Danish Archipelago. Denmark is located southwest of Sweden and due south of Norway and is bordered by the German state (and former possession) Schleswig-Holstein to the south, on Denmark's only land border, 68 kilometres (42 miles) long. Denmark borders both the Baltic and North Seas along its 7,314 km (4,545 mi) tidal shoreline. Denmark's general coastline is much shorter, at 1,701 km (1,057 mi), as it would not include most of the 1,419 offshore islands (each defined as exceeding 100 square meters in area) and the 180 km long Limfjorden, which separates Denmark's second largest island, North Jutlandic Island, 4,686 km2 in size, from the rest of Jutland. No location in Denmark is further from the coast than 52 km (32 mi). The size of the land area of Denmark cannot be stated exactly since the ocean constantly erodes and adds material to the coastline, and because of human land reclamation projects (to counter erosion). On the southwest coast of Jutland, the tide is between 1 and 2 m (3.28 and 6.56 ft), and the tideline moves outward and inward on a 10 km (6.2 mi) stretch. A circle enclosing the same area as Denmark would be 742 km (461 miles) long. Denmark has 443 named islands (1,419 islands above 100 m²), of which 72 are inhabited (as of 1 January 2007, Statistics Denmark). The largest islands are Zealand (Sjælland) and Funen (Fyn). The island of Bornholm is located east of the rest of the country, in the Baltic Sea. Many of the larger islands are connected by bridges; the Øresund Bridge connects Zealand with Sweden; the Great Belt Bridge connects Funen with Zealand; and the Little Belt Bridge connects Jutland with Funen. Ferries or small aircraft connect to the smaller islands. Main cities are the capital Copenhagen on Zealand; Århus, Aalborg and Esbjerg in Jutland; and Odense on Funen. Denmark experiences a temperate climate. This means that the winters are mild and windy and the summers are cool. The local terrain is generally flat with a few gently rolling plains. The territory of Denmark includes the island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea and the rest of metropolitan Denmark, but excludes the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Its position gives Denmark complete control of the Danish Straits (Skagerrak and Kattegat) linking the Baltic and North Seas.

"David Robert Joseph Beckham, OBE (/ˈbɛkəm/; born 2 May 1975) is an English former professional footballer. He played for Manchester United, Preston North End, Real Madrid, Milan, LA Galaxy, Paris Saint-Germain, and the England national team for which he holds the appearance record for an outfield player. He is the first English player to win league titles in four countries: England, Spain, the United States and France. He announced his retirement in May 2013 after a 20-year career, during which he won 19 major trophies. Known for his range of passing, crossing ability and bending free-kicks, he was twice runner-up for FIFA World Player of the Year and in 2004 he was named in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players. Beckham's professional club career began with Manchester United, where he made his first-team debut in 1992 aged 17. With United, he won the Premier League title six times, the FA Cup twice, and the UEFA Champions League in 1999. He then played four seasons with Real Madrid, winning the La Liga championship in his final season with the club. In July 2007 Beckham signed a five-year contract with Major League Soccer club LA Galaxy. While a Galaxy player, he spent two loan spells in Italy with Milan in 2009 and 2010. He was the first British footballer to play 100 UEFA Champions League games. In international football, Beckham made his England debut on 1 September 1996 at the age of 21. He was captain for six years, earning 58 caps during his tenure. He made 115 career appearances in total, appearing at three FIFA World Cup tournaments, the 1998, 2002 and 2006 editions and two UEFA European Championship tournaments, the 2000 and 2004 editions.

"Greece (/ɡriːs/ GREESS; Greek: Ελλάδα, Elláda [eˈlaða]), officially the Hellenic Republic (Greek: Ελληνική Δημοκρατία, Ellīnikī́ Dīmokratía [eliniˈci ðimokraˈti.a]) and known since ancient times as Hellas (/ˈhɛləs/; Greek: Ελλάς, Ellás), is a country located in southeastern Europe. According to the 2011 census, Greece's population is around 10.8 million. Athens is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Thessaloniki, which is commonly referred to as the co-capital. Greece is strategically located at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa. Situated on the southern tip of the Balkan peninsula, it shares land borders with Albania to the northwest, the Republic of Macedonia and Bulgaria to the north and Turkey to the northeast. Greece consists of nine geographic regions: Macedonia, Central Greece, the Peloponnese, Thessaly, Epirus, the Aegean Islands (including the Dodecanese and Cyclades), Thrace, Crete, and the Ionian Islands. The Aegean Sea lies to the east of the mainland, the Ionian Sea to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. Greece has the longest coastline on the Mediterranean Basin and the 11th longest coastline in the world at 13,676 km (8,498 mi) in length, featuring a vast number of islands, of which 227 are inhabited. Eighty percent of Greece is mountainous, with Mount Olympus being the highest peak at 2,918 metres (9,573 ft). Greece has one of the longest histories of any country, and is considered the cradle of Western civilization, and as such, is the birthplace of democracy, Western philosophy, the Olympic Games, Western literature, historiography, political science, major scientific and mathematical principles, and Western drama, including both tragedy and comedy. Greece was first unified under Philip of Macedon in the fourth century BC. His son Alexander the Great rapidly conquered much of the ancient world, spreading Greek culture and science from the eastern Mediterranean to the Indus River. Annexed by Rome in the second century BC, Greece became an integral part of the Roman Empire and its successor, the Byzantine Empire. The first century AD saw the establishment of the Greek Orthodox Church, which shaped the modern Greek identity and transmitted Greek traditions to the wider Orthodox World. Falling under Ottoman dominion in the mid-15th century, the modern nation state of Greece emerged in 1830 following the war of independence. Greece's rich historical legacy is reflected in large part by its 17 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, among the most in Europe and the world. Greece is a democratic and developed country with an advanced high-income economy, a high quality of life and a very high standard of living. A founding member of the United Nations, Greece was the tenth member to join the European Communities (precursor to the European Union) and has been part of the Eurozone since 2001. It is also a member of numerous other international institutions, including the Council of Europe, NATO, OECD, OIF, OSCE and the WTO.

"Hungary (/ˈhʌŋɡəri/; Hungarian: Magyarország [ˈmɒɟɒrorsaːɡ]) is a sovereign state in Europe. It is situated in the Carpathian Basin and is bordered by Slovakia to the north, Romania to the east, Serbia to the south, Croatia to the southwest, Slovenia to the west, Austria to the northwest, and Ukraine to the northeast. The country's capital and largest city is Budapest. Hungary is a member of the European Union, NATO, the OECD, the Visegrád Group, and the Schengen Area. The official language is Hungarian, which is the most widely spoken non-Indo-European language in Europe. Following centuries of successive habitation by Celts, Romans, Huns, Slavs, Gepids, and Avars, the foundation of Hungary was laid in the late 9th century by the Hungarian grand prince Árpád in the Honfoglalás (""homeland-conquest""). His great-grandson Stephen I ascended to the throne in 1000 CE, converting the country to a Christian kingdom. By the 12th century, Hungary became a middle power within the Western world, reaching a golden age by the 15th century. Following the Battle of Mohács in 1526 and about 150 years of partial Ottoman occupation (1541–1699), Hungary came under Habsburg rule, and later formed a significant part of the Austro–Hungarian Empire (1867–1918). Hungary's current borders were first established by the Treaty of Trianon (1920) after World War I, when the country lost 71% of its territory, 58% of its population, and 32% of ethnic Hungarians. Following the interwar period, Hungary joined the Axis Powers in World War II, suffering significant damage and casualties. Hungary came under the influence of the Soviet Union, which contributed to the establishment of a four-decade-long communist dictatorship (1947–1989). The country gained widespread international attention regarding the Revolution of 1956 and the seminal opening of its previously-restricted border with Austria in 1989, which accelerated the collapse of the Eastern Bloc. On 23 October 1989, Hungary again became a democratic parliamentary republic, and today has a high-income economy with a very high Human Development Index. Hungary is a popular tourist destination attracting 10.675 million tourists a year (2013). It is home to the largest thermal water cave system and the second-largest thermal lake in the world (Lake Hévíz), the largest lake in Central Europe (Lake Balaton), and the largest natural grasslands in Europe (the Hortobágy National Park).","[('Slovakia', 'Austria', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Slovakia', 'Ukraine', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Slovakia', 'It', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Romania', 'Serbia', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Romania', 'Ukraine', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Romania', 'It', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Serbia', 'Romania', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Serbia', 'Croatia', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Serbia', 'It', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Croatia', 'Serbia', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Croatia', 'Slovenia', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Croatia', 'It', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Slovenia', 'Croatia', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Slovenia', 'Austria', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Slovenia', 'It', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Austria', 'Slovakia', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Austria', 'Slovenia', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Austria', 'It', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Ukraine', 'Slovakia', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Ukraine', 'Romania', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Ukraine', 'It', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('It', 'Slovakia', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('It', 'Romania', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('It', 'Serbia', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('It', 'Croatia', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('It', 'Slovenia', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('It', 'Austria', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('It', 'Ukraine', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Hungary', 'European Union', 'member of', 'P463'), ('Hungary', 'NATO', 'member of', 'P463'), ('Hungary', 'OECD', 'member of', 'P463'), ('Schengen Area', 'Hungary', 'member', 'P527')]","['Hungary (/ˈhʌŋɡəri/; Hungarian: Magyarország [ˈmɒɟɒrorsaːɡ]) is a sovereign state in Europe.', 'It is situated in the Carpathian Basin and is bordered by Slovakia to the north, Romania to the east, Serbia to the south, Croatia to the southwest, Slovenia to the west, Austria to the northwest, and Ukraine to the northeast.', ""The country's capital and largest city is Budapest."", 'Hungary is a member of the European Union, NATO, the OECD, the Visegrád Group, and the Schengen Area.', 'The official language is Hungarian, which is the most widely spoken non-Indo-European language in Europe.', 'Following centuries of successive habitation by Celts, Romans, Huns, Slavs, Gepids, and Avars, the foundation of Hungary was laid in the late 9th century by the Hungarian grand prince Árpád in the Honfoglalás (""homeland-conquest"").', 'His great-grandson Stephen I ascended to the throne in 1000 CE, converting the country to a Christian kingdom.', 'By the 12th century, Hungary became a middle power within the Western world, reaching a golden age by the 15th century.', 'Following the Battle of Mohács in 1526 and about 150 years of partial Ottoman occupation (1541–1699), Hungary came under Habsburg rule, and later formed a significant part of the Austro–Hungarian Empire (1867–1918).', ""Hungary's current borders were first established by the Treaty of Trianon (1920) after World War I, when the country lost 71% of its territory, 58% of its population, and 32% of ethnic Hungarians."", 'Following the interwar period, Hungary joined the Axis Powers in World War II, suffering significant damage and casualties.', 'Hungary came under the influence of the Soviet Union, which contributed to the establishment of a four-decade-long communist dictatorship (1947–1989).', 'The country gained widespread international attention regarding the Revolution of 1956 and the seminal opening of its previously-restricted border with Austria in 1989, which accelerated the collapse of the Eastern Bloc.', 'On 23 October 1989, Hungary again became a democratic parliamentary republic, and today has a high-income economy with a very high Human Development Index.', 'Hungary is a popular tourist destination attracting 10.675 million tourists a year (2013).', 'It is home to the largest thermal water cave system and the second-largest thermal lake in the world (Lake Hévíz), the largest lake in Central Europe (Lake Balaton), and the largest natural grasslands in Europe (the Hortobágy National Park).']",16,241,40
"The Hebrew alphabet (Hebrew: אָלֶף־בֵּית עִבְרִי, alefbet ʿIvri), known variously by scholars as the Jewish script, square script, block script, is used in the writing of the Hebrew language, as well as of other Jewish languages, most notably Yiddish, Ladino, and Judeo-Arabic. There have been two script forms in use; the original old Hebrew script is known as the paleo-Hebrew script (which has been largely preserved, in an altered form, in the Samaritan script), while the present ""square"" form of the Hebrew alphabet is a stylized form of the Aramaic script and was known by Israel's sages as the Ashuri script (Assyrian script), since its origins were alleged to be from Assyria. Various ""styles"" (in current terms, ""fonts"") of representation of the letters exist. There is also a cursive Hebrew script, which has also varied over time and place. The Hebrew alphabet has 22 letters. It does not have case, but five letters have different forms when used at the end of a word. Hebrew is written from right to left. Originally, the alphabet was an abjad consisting only of consonants. As with other abjads, such as the Arabic alphabet, scribes later devised means of indicating vowel sounds by separate vowel points, known in Hebrew as niqqud. In rabbinic Hebrew, the letters א ה ו י are also used as matres lectionis (the use of certain consonants to indicate a vowel) to represent vowels. When used to write Yiddish, the writing system is a true alphabet (except for borrowed Hebrew words). In modern usage of the alphabet, as in the case of Yiddish (except that ע replaces ה) and to some extent modern Israeli Hebrew, vowels may be indicated.

"Italy (/ˈɪtəli/; Italian: Italia [iˈtaːlja]), officially the Italian Republic (Italian: Repubblica Italiana), is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Italy covers an area of 301,338 km2 (116,347 sq mi) and has a largely temperate seasonal climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as lo Stivale (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the 4th most populous EU member state. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Since classical times, Greeks, Etruscans and Celts have inhabited the south, centre and north of the Italian Peninsula respectively, with various Italic peoples dispersed throughout Italy alongside other ancient Italian tribes and Greek, Carthaginian, and Phoenician colonies. Prehistoric Italy was also home to a variety of ancient Bronze Age and early Iron Age cultures (such as the Villanovan, Apennine, Terramare, Ligurian, Nuragic, Sicani, and Polada cultures) in addition to various Italic tribes (such as the Oscans and Umbrians). The Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom, which eventually spread throughout Italy, assimilating and conquering other nearby civilizations such as the Sabines and Etruscans and forming the Ancient Roman Republic. Rome ultimately emerged as the dominant power, conquering much of the ancient world and becoming the leading cultural, political, and religious centre of Western civilisation. The legacy of the Roman Empire is widespread and can be observed in the global distribution of civilian law, Republican governments, Christianity and the latin script. During the Dark Ages, Italy suffered sociopolitical collapse amid calamitous barbarian invasions, but by the 11th century, numerous rival city-states (e.g. Florence) and maritime republics (e.g. Venice) rose to great prosperity through shipping, commerce, and banking, and even laid the groundwork for capitalism. These independent city-states and regional republics, acting as Europe's main port of entry for Asian and Near Eastern imported goods, often enjoyed a greater degree of democracy in comparison to the monarchies and feudal states found throughout Europe at the time, though much of central Italy remained under the control of the theocratic Papal States, while Southern Italy remained largely feudal until the 19th century, partially as a result of a succession of Byzantine, Arab, Norman, Spanish, and Bourbon conquests of the region. During the Renaissance, a period of renewed interest in humanism, science, exploration and art, Italy and the rest of Europe entered the modern era. The Italian culture flourished at this time, producing famous scholars, artists, and polymaths such as Leonardo da Vinci, Galileo, Michelangelo and Machiavelli. Italian explorers such as Marco Polo, Christopher Columbus, Amerigo Vespucci, and Giovanni da Verrazzano discovered new routes to the Far East and the New World, helping to usher in the European Age of Discovery. Nevertheless, Italy's importance as a commercial and political power significantly waned with the opening of trade routes from the New World, as New World imports and trade routes became more influential in Europe and bypassed the East Asian and Mediterranean trade routes that the Italian city-states had dominated. Furthermore, the Italian city-states constantly engaged one another in bloody warfare, with this tension and violent rivalry culminating in the Italian Wars of the 15th and 16th centuries, a series of wars and foreign invasions that left the Italian states vulnerable to annexation by neighboring European powers. Italy would remain politically fragmented and fall prey to occupation, colonization, conquest, and general foreign domination by European powers such as France, Spain, and later Austria, subsequently entering a long period of decline. By the mid-19th century, a rising movement in support of Italian nationalism and Italian independence from foreign control lead to a period of revolutionary political upheaval known as the Risorgimento, which sought to bring about a rebirth of Italian cultural and economic prominence by liberating and consolidating the Italian peninsula and insular Italy into an independent and unified nation-state. After various unsuccessful attempts, the Italian Wars of Independence, the Expedition of the Thousand and the capture of Rome resulted in the eventual unification of the country, now a great power after centuries of foreign domination and political division. From the late 19th century to the early 20th century, the new Kingdom of Italy rapidly industrialized, especially in Northern cities such as Milan, Turin and Genoa, and soon acquired a colonial empire. However, the southern and rural areas of the country remained largely excluded from industrialization, fueling a large and influential diaspora. Despite being one of the main victors in World War I, Italy entered a period of economic crisis and social turmoil, leading the way to the rise of a Fascist dictatorship in 1922. The subsequent participation in World War II on the Axis side ended in military defeat, economic destruction and civil war. In the years that followed, Italy abolished the Italian monarchy, reinstated democracy, and enjoyed a prolonged economic boom, thus becoming one of the world's most developed nations. Italy has the third largest economy in the Eurozone and the eighth largest economy in the world. It has a very high level of human development and enjoys the highest life expectancy in the EU. Italy plays a prominent role in regional and global military, cultural and diplomatic affairs. Italy is a founding and leading member of the European Union and the member of numerous international institutions, including the UN, NATO, the OECD, the OSCE, the WTO, the G7/G8, G20, the Union for the Mediterranean, the Council of Europe, Uniting for Consensus, and many more. As a reflection of its vast cultural wealth, Italy is home to 51 World Heritage Sites, the most in the world, and is one of the most visited countries.","[('Italy', 'France', 'borders', 'P47'),

seasonal climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as lo Stivale (the Boot).', 'With 61 million inhabitants, it is the 4th most populous EU member state.', 'Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City.', 'Since classical times, Greeks, Etruscans and Celts have inhabited the south, centre and north of the Italian Peninsula respectively, with various Italic peoples dispersed throughout Italy alongside other ancient Italian tribes and Greek, Carthaginian, and Phoenician colonies.', 'Prehistoric Italy was also home to a variety of ancient Bronze Age and early Iron Age cultures (such as the Villanovan, Apennine, Terramare, Ligurian, Nuragic, Sicani, and Polada cultures) in addition to various Italic tribes (such as the Oscans and Umbrians).', 'The Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom, which eventually spread throughout Italy, assimilating and conquering other nearby civilizations such as the Sabines and Etruscans and forming the Ancient Roman Republic.', 'Rome ultimately emerged as the dominant power, conquering much of the ancient world and becoming the leading cultural, political, and religious centre of Western civilisation.', 'The legacy of the Roman Empire is widespread and can be observed in the global distribution of civilian law, Republican governments, Christianity and the latin script.', 'During the Dark Ages, Italy suffered sociopolitical collapse amid calamitous barbarian invasions, but by the 11th century, numerous rival city-states (e.g.', 'Florence) and maritime republics (e.g.', 'Venice) rose to great prosperity through shipping, commerce, and banking, and even laid the groundwork for capitalism.', ""These independent city-states and regional republics, acting as Europe's main port of entry for Asian and Near Eastern imported goods, often enjoyed a greater degree of democracy in comparison to the monarchies and feudal states found throughout Europe at the time, though much of central Italy remained under the control of the theocratic Papal States, while Southern Italy remained largely feudal until the 19th century, partially as a result of a succession of Byzantine, Arab, Norman, Spanish, and Bourbon conquests of the region."", 'During the Renaissance, a period of renewed interest in humanism, science, exploration and art, Italy and the rest of Europe entered the modern era.', 'The Italian culture flourished at this time, producing famous scholars, artists, and

routes to the Far East and the New World, helping to usher in the European Age of Discovery.', ""Nevertheless, Italy's importance as a commercial and political power significantly waned with the opening of trade routes from the New World, as New World imports and trade routes became more influential in Europe and bypassed the East Asian and Mediterranean trade routes that the Italian city-states had dominated."", 'Furthermore, the Italian city-states constantly engaged one another in bloody warfare, with this tension and violent rivalry culminating in the Italian Wars of the 15th

prey to occupation, colonization, conquest, and general foreign domination by European powers such as France, Spain, and later Austria, subsequently entering a long period of decline.', 'By the mid-19th century, a rising movement in support of Italian nationalism and Italian independence from foreign control lead to a period of revolutionary political upheaval known as the Risorgimento,

"Kazakhstan (/ˌkæzækˈstɑːn, ˌkɑː-, -zɑːk-, -ˈstæn/; Kazakh: Қазақстан, Qazaqstan), officially the Republic of Kazakhstan, is a country in Central Asia, with a minor part west of the Ural River and thus in Europe. Kazakhstan is the world's largest landlocked country by land area and the ninth largest country in the world. Its territory of 2,724,900 square kilometres (1,052,100 sq mi) is larger than all of Western Europe. By 2006, Kazakhstan had become the dominant nation of Central Asia economically, generating 60% of the region's GDP, primarily through its oil/gas industry. The country has vast mineral resources. It has borders with (clockwise from the north) Russia, China, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan, and also adjoins a large part of the Caspian Sea. The terrain of Kazakhstan includes flatlands, steppe, taiga, rock canyons, hills, deltas, snow-capped mountains, and deserts. With an estimated 18 million people as of 2014, Kazakhstan is the 61st most populous country in the world. Given its large land area, its population density is among the lowest, at less than 6 people per square kilometre (15 people per sq. mi.). The capital is Astana, where it was moved in 1997 from Almaty. The territory of Kazakhstan has historically been inhabited by nomadic tribes. This changed in the 13th century, when Genghis Khan occupied the country as part of the Mongolian Empire. Following internal struggles among the conquerors, power eventually reverted to the nomads. By the 16th century, the Kazakh emerged as a distinct group, divided into three jüz (ancestor branches occupying specific territories). The Russians began advancing into the Kazakh steppe in the 18th century, and by the mid-19th century, they nominally ruled all of Kazakhstan as part of the Russian Empire. Following the 1917 Russian Revolution and subsequent civil war, the territory of Kazakhstan was reorganized several times. In 1936 it was made the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, considered an integral part of the Soviet Union. Kazakhstan was the last of the Soviet republics to declare independence following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. The current President, Nursultan Nazarbayev, has been leader of the country since then, and is characterized as authoritarian, with a government history of human rights abuses and suppression of political opposition. Kazakhstan has worked to develop its economy, especially its dominant hydrocarbon industry. Human Rights Watch says that ""Kazakhstan heavily restricts freedom of assembly, speech, and religion,"" and other human rights organizations regularly describe Kazakhstan's human rights situation as poor. Kazakhstan is populated by 131 ethnicities, including Kazakhs (who make up 63 percent of the population), Russians, Uzbeks, Ukrainians, Germans, Tatars, and Uyghurs. Islam is the religion of about 70% of the population, with Christianity practiced by 26%; Kazakhstan officially allows freedom of religion, but religious leaders who oppose the government are suppressed. The Kazakh language is the state language, and Russian has equal official status for all levels of administrative and institutional purposes, reflecting the long history of Russian dominance in the region.","[('Ural River', 'Kazakhstan', 'country', 'P17'), ('Ural River', 'Qazaqstan', 'country', 'P17'), ('Ural River', 'Kazakhstan', 'country', 'P17'), ('Russia', 'China', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Russia', 'It', 'borders', 'P47'), ('China', 'Russia', 'borders', 'P47'), ('China', 'Kyrgyzstan', 'borders', 'P47'), ('China', 'It', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Kyrgyzstan', 'China', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Kyrgyzstan', 'Uzbekistan', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Kyrgyzstan', 'It', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Uzbekistan', 'Kyrgyzstan', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Uzbekistan', 'Turkmenistan', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Uzbekistan', 'It', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Turkmenistan', 'Uzbekistan', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Turkmenistan', 'It', 'borders', 'P47'), ('It', 'Russia', 'borders', 'P47'), ('It', 'China', 'borders', 'P47'), ('It', 'Kyrgyzstan', 'borders', 'P47'), ('It', 'Uzbekistan', 'borders', 'P47'), ('It', 'Turkmenistan', 'borders', 'P47')]","['Kazakhstan (/ˌkæzækˈstɑːn, ˌkɑː-, -zɑːk-, -ˈstæn/; Kazakh: Қазақстан, Qazaqstan), officially the Republic of Kazakhstan, is a country in Central Asia, with a minor part west of the Ural River and thus in Europe.', ""Kazakhstan is the world's largest landlocked country by land area and the ninth largest country in the world."", 'Its territory of 2,724,900 square kilometres (1,052,100 sq mi) is larger than all of Western Europe.', ""By 2006, Kazakhstan had become the dominant nation of Central Asia economically, generating 60% of the region's GDP, primarily through its oil/gas industry."", 'The country has vast mineral resources.', 'It has borders with (clockwise from the north) Russia, China, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan, and also adjoins a large part of the Caspian Sea.', 'The terrain of Kazakhstan includes flatlands, steppe, taiga, rock canyons, hills, deltas, snow-capped mountains, and deserts.', 'With an estimated 18 million people as of 2014, Kazakhstan is the 61st most populous country in the world.', 'Given its large land area, its population density is among the lowest, at less than 6 people per square kilometre (15 people per sq.', 'mi.).', 'The capital is Astana, where it was moved in 1997 from Almaty.', 'The territory of Kazakhstan has historically been inhabited by nomadic tribes.', 'This changed in the 13th century, when Genghis Khan occupied the country as part of the Mongolian Empire.', 'Following internal struggles among the conquerors, power eventually reverted to the nomads.', 'By the 16th century, the Kazakh emerged as a distinct group, divided into three jüz (ancestor branches occupying specific territories).', 'The Russians began advancing into the Kazakh steppe in the 18th century, and by the mid-19th century, they nominally ruled all of Kazakhstan as part of the Russian Empire.', 'Following the 1917 Russian Revolution and subsequent civil war, the territory of Kazakhstan was reorganized several times.', 'In 1936 it was made the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, considered an integral part of the Soviet Union.', 'Kazakhstan was the last of the Soviet republics to declare independence following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.', 'The current President, Nursultan Nazarbayev, has been leader of the country since then, and is characterized as authoritarian, with a government history of human rights abuses and suppression of political opposition.', 'Kazakhstan has worked to develop its economy, especially its dominant hydrocarbon industry.', 'Human Rights Watch says that ""Kazakhstan heavily restricts freedom of assembly, speech, and religion,"" and other human rights organizations regularly describe Kazakhstan\'s human rights situation as poor.', 'Kazakhstan is populated by 131 ethnicities, including Kazakhs (who make up 63 percent of the population), Russians, Uzbeks, Ukrainians, Germans, Tatars, and Uyghurs.', 'Islam is the religion of about 70% of the population, with Christianity practiced by 26%; Kazakhstan officially allows freedom of religion, but religious leaders who oppose the government are suppressed.', 'The Kazakh language is the state language, and Russian has equal official status for all levels of administrative and institutional purposes, reflecting the long history of Russian dominance in the region.']",25,216,32
"Karnataka (Kannada:ಕರ್ನಾಟಕ, IPA:/kərˈnɑːtəkə, kɑːr-/) is a state in south western region of India. It was formed on 1 November 1956, with the passage of the States Reorganisation Act. Originally known as the State of Mysore, it was renamed Karnataka in 1973. The capital and largest city is Bangalore (Bengaluru). Karnataka is bordered by the Arabian Sea and the Laccadive Sea to the west, Goa to the north west, Maharashtra to the north, Telangana to the North east, Andhra Pradesh to the east, Tamil Nadu to the south east, and Kerala to the south west. The state covers an area of 191,976 square kilometres (74,122 sq mi), or 5.83 per cent of the total geographical area of India. It is the seventh largest Indian state by area. With 61,130,704 inhabitants at the 2011 census, Karnataka is the eighth largest state by population, comprising 30 districts. Kannada is the most widely spoken and official language of the state. The two main river systems of the state are the Krishna and its tributaries, the Bhima, Ghataprabha, Vedavathi, Malaprabha, and Tungabhadra, in the north, and the Kaveri and its tributaries, the Hemavati, Shimsha, Arkavati, Lakshmana Thirtha and Kabini, in the south. Most of these rivers flow out of Karnataka eastward into the Bay of Bengal. Though several etymologies have been suggested for the name Karnataka, the generally accepted one is that Karnataka is derived from the Kannada words karu and nādu, meaning ""elevated land"". Karu nadu may also be read as karu, meaning ""black"", and nadu, meaning ""region"", as a reference to the black cotton soil found in the Bayalu Seeme region of the state. The British used the word Carnatic, sometimes Karnatak, to describe both sides of peninsular India, south of the Krishna. With an antiquity that dates to the paleolithic, Karnataka has been home to some of the most powerful empires of ancient and medieval India. The philosophers and musical bards patronised by these empires launched socio-religious and literary movements which have endured to the present day. Karnataka has contributed significantly to both forms of Indian classical music, the Carnatic and Hindustani traditions.","[('Karnataka', 'Goa', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Karnataka', 'Maharashtra', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Karnataka', 'Telangana', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Karnataka', 'Andhra Pradesh', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Karnataka', 'Tamil Nadu', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Karnataka', 'Kerala', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Goa', 'Karnataka', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Goa', 'Maharashtra', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Maharashtra', 'Karnataka', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Maharashtra', 'Goa', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Maharashtra', 'Telangana', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Telangana', 'Karnataka', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Telangana', 'Maharashtra', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Telangana', 'Andhra Pradesh', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Andhra Pradesh', 'Karnataka', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Andhra Pradesh', 'Telangana', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Andhra Pradesh', 'Tamil Nadu', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Tamil Nadu', 'Karnataka', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Tamil Nadu', 'Andhra Pradesh', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Tamil Nadu', 'Kerala', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Kerala', 'Karnataka', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Kerala', 'Tamil Nadu', 'bordered by', 'P47')]","['Karnataka (Kannada:ಕರ್ನಾಟಕ, IPA:/kərˈnɑːtəkə, kɑːr-/) is a state in south western region of India.', 'It was formed on 1 November 1956, with the passage of the States Reorganisation Act.', 'Originally known as the State of Mysore, it was renamed Karnataka in 1973.', 'The capital and largest city is Bangalore (Bengaluru).', 'Karnataka is bordered by the Arabian Sea and the Laccadive Sea to the west, Goa to the north west, Maharashtra to the north, Telangana to the North east, Andhra Pradesh to the east, Tamil Nadu to the south east, and Kerala to the south west.', 'The state covers an area of 191,976 square kilometres (74,122 sq mi), or 5.83 per cent of the total geographical area of India.', 'It is the seventh largest Indian state by area.', 'With 61,130,704 inhabitants at the 2011 census, Karnataka is the eighth largest state by population, comprising 30 districts.', 'Kannada is the most widely spoken and official language of the state.', 'The two main river systems of the state are the Krishna and its tributaries, the Bhima, Ghataprabha, Vedavathi, Malaprabha, and Tungabhadra, in the north, and the Kaveri and its tributaries, the Hemavati, Shimsha, Arkavati, Lakshmana Thirtha and Kabini, in the south.', 'Most of these rivers flow out of Karnataka eastward into the Bay of Bengal.', 'Though several etymologies have been suggested for the name Karnataka, the generally accepted one is that Karnataka is derived from the Kannada words karu and nādu, meaning ""elevated land"".', 'Karu nadu may also be read as karu, meaning ""black"", and nadu, meaning ""region"", as a reference to the black cotton soil found in the Bayalu Seeme region of the state.', 'The British used the word Carnatic, sometimes Karnatak, to describe both sides of peninsular India, south of the Krishna.', 'With an antiquity that dates to the paleolithic, Karnataka has been home to some of the most powerful empires of ancient and medieval India.', 'The philosophers and musical bards patronised by these empires launched socio-religious and literary movements which have endured to the present day.', 'Karnataka has contributed significantly to both forms of Indian classical music, the Carnatic and Hindustani traditions.']",17,267,45
"Libya (Arabic: ليبيا Lībiyā) is a country in the Maghreb region of North Africa bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, Egypt to the east, Sudan to the southeast, Chad and Niger to the south, and Algeria and Tunisia to the west. The three traditional parts of the country are Tripolitania, Fezzan and Cyrenaica. With an area of almost 1.8 million square kilometres (700,000 sq mi), Libya is the fourth largest country in Africa, and is the 16th largest country in the world. Libya has the 10th-largest proven oil reserves of any country in the world. The largest city and capital, Tripoli, is located in western Libya and contains over one million of Libya's six million people. The other large city is Benghazi, which is located in eastern Libya. Libya has been inhabited by Berbers since the late Bronze Age. The Phoenicians established trading posts in western Libya, and Ancient Greek colonists established city-states in eastern Libya. Libya was variously ruled by Persians, Egyptians and Greeks before becoming a part of the Roman Empire. Libya was an early center of Christianity. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the area of Libya was mostly occupied by the Vandals until the 7th century, when invasions brought Islam and Arab colonization. In the sixteenth century, the Spanish Empire and the Knights of St John occupied Tripoli, until Ottoman rule began in 1551. Libya was involved in the Barbary Wars of the 18th and 19th centuries. Ottoman rule continued until the Italian occupation of Libya resulted in the temporary Italian Libya colony from 1911 to 1943. During the Second World War Libya was an important area of warfare in the North African Campaign. The Italian population then went into decline. Libya became an independent kingdom in 1951. In 1969, a military coup overthrew King Idris I, beginning a period of brutal suppression of dissent. The most prominent coup conspirator, Muammar Gaddafi, was ultimately able to fully concentrate power in his own hands during the Libyan Cultural Revolution, remaining in power until the Libyan Civil War of 2011, in which the rebels were supported by NATO. Since then, Libya has experienced instability and political violence which has severely affected both commerce and oil production. The European Union is involved in an operation to disrupt human trafficking networks exploiting refugees fleeing from the war for Europe. At least two political bodies claim to be the government of Libya. The Council of Deputies is internationally recognized as the legitimate government, but it does not hold territory in the capital, Tripoli, instead meeting in the Cyrenaica city of Tobruk. Meanwhile, the New General National Congress purports to be the legal continuation of the General National Congress, elected in the Libyan General National Congress election, 2012 and was dissolved following the June 2014 elections but then reconvened by a minority of its members. The Supreme Court in the Libya Dawn and New General National Congress-controlled Tripoli declared the Tobruk government unconstitutional in November 2014, but the internationally recognized government has rejected the ruling as made under threat of violence. Parts of Libya are outside of either government's control, with various Islamist, rebel, and tribal militias administering some cities and areas. The United Nations is sponsoring peace talks between the Tobruk and Tripoli-based factions. An agreement to form a unified interim government was signed on 17 December 2015. Under the terms of the agreement, a nine-member Presidency Council and a seventeen-member interim Government of National Accord would be formed, with a view to holding new elections within two

Since 1975, it has been ruled by a Marxist and communist government. Its population was estimated to be around 6.8 million in July 2014. Laos traces its history to the kingdom of Lan Xang, which existed from the 14th to the 18th century when it split into three kingdoms. In 1893, it became a French protectorate, with the three kingdoms—Luang Phrabang, Vientiane and Champasak — uniting to form what is now known as Laos. It briefly gained independence in 1945 after Japanese occupation, but returned to French rule until it was granted autonomy in 1949. Laos became independent in 1953, with a constitutional monarchy under Sisavang Vong. Shortly after independence, a long civil war ended the monarchy, when the Communist Pathet Lao movement came to power in 1975. Laos is a one-party socialist republic. It espouses Marxism and is governed by a single party communist politburo dominated by military generals. The Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnam People's Army continue to have significant influence in Laos. The capital city is Vientiane. Other large cities include Luang Prabang, Savannakhet, and Pakse. The official language is Lao. Laos is a multi-ethnic country with the politically and culturally dominant Lao people making up approximately 60% of the population, mostly in the lowlands. Mon-Khmer groups, the Hmong, and other indigenous hill tribes, accounting for 40% of the population, live in the foothills and mountains. Laos' strategy for development is based on generating electricity from its rivers and selling the power to its neighbours, namely Thailand, China, and Vietnam. Its economy is accelerating rapidly with the demands for its metals. It is a member of the Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement (APTA), Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), East Asia Summit and La Francophonie. Laos applied for membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1997; on 2 February 2013, it was granted full membership. According to the anti-corruption non-governmental organisation Transparency International, Laos remains one of the most corrupt countries in the world. This has deterred foreign investment and created major problems with the rule of law, including the nation's ability to enforce contract and business regulation. This has contributed to a third of the population of Laos currently living below the international poverty line (living on less than US$1.25 per day).

"Lower Saxony (German: Niedersachsen [ˈniːdɐzaksən], Low German: Neddersassen) is a German state (Bundesland) situated in northwestern Germany and is second in area, with 47,624 square kilometres (18,388 sq mi), and fourth in population (8 million) among the sixteen Länder of Germany. In rural areas Northern Low Saxon, a dialect of Low German, and Saterland Frisian, a variety of Frisian, are still spoken, but the number of speakers is declining. Lower Saxony borders on (from north and clockwise) the North Sea, the states of Schleswig-Holstein, Hamburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Brandenburg, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia, Hesse and North Rhine-Westphalia, and the Netherlands. Furthermore, the state of Bremen forms two enclaves within Lower Saxony, one being the city of Bremen, the other, its seaport city of Bremerhaven. In fact, Lower Saxony borders more neighbours than any other single Bundesland. The state's principal cities include the state capital Hanover, Braunschweig (Brunswick), Lüneburg, Osnabrück, Oldenburg, Hildesheim, Wolfenbüttel, Wolfsburg and Göttingen. The northwestern area of Lower Saxony, which lies on the coast of the North Sea, is called East Frisia and the seven East Frisian Islands offshore are popular with tourists. In the extreme west of Lower Saxony is the Emsland, a traditionally poor and sparsely populated area, once dominated by inaccessible swamps. The northern half of Lower Saxony, also known as the North German Plains, is almost invariably flat except for the gentle hills around the Bremen geestland. Towards the south and southwest lie the northern parts of the German Central Uplands: the Weser Uplands and the Harz mountains. Between these two lie the Lower Saxon Hills, a range of low ridges. Thus, Lower Saxony is the only Bundesland that encompasses both maritime and mountainous areas. Lower Saxony's major cities and economic centres are mainly situated in its central and southern parts, namely Hanover, Braunschweig, Osnabrück, Wolfsburg, Salzgitter, Hildesheim and Göttingen. Oldenburg, near the northwestern coastline, is another economic centre. The region in the northeast is called the Lüneburg Heath (Lüneburger Heide), the largest heathland area of Germany and in medieval times wealthy due to salt mining and salt trade, as well as to a lesser degree the exploitation of its peat bogs up until about the 1960s. To the north, the Elbe river separates Lower Saxony from Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Brandenburg. The banks just south of the Elbe are known as Altes Land (Old Country). Due to its gentle local climate and fertile soil it is the state's largest area of fruit farming, its chief produce being apples. Most of the state's territory was part of the historic Kingdom of Hanover; the state of Lower Saxony has adopted the coat of arms and other symbols of the former kingdom. It was created by the merger of the State of Hanover with several smaller states in 1946.","[('Lower Saxony', 'Bundesland', 'is a', 'P31'), ('Lower Saxony', 'Länder', 'is a', 'P31'), ('Niedersachsen', 'Bundesland', 'is a', 'P31'), ('Niedersachsen', 'Länder', 'is a', 'P31'), ('Lower Saxony', 'Schleswig-Holstein', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Lower Saxony', 'Hamburg', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Lower Saxony', 'Mecklenburg-Vorpommern', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Lower Saxony', 'Brandenburg', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Lower Saxony', 'Saxony-Anhalt', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Lower Saxony', 'Thuringia', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Lower Saxony', 'Hesse', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Lower Saxony', 'North Rhine-Westphalia', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Schleswig-Holstein', 'Lower Saxony', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Schleswig-Holstein', 'Hamburg', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Schleswig-Holstein', 'Mecklenburg-Vorpommern', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Hamburg', 'Lower Saxony', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Hamburg', 'Schleswig-Holstein', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Mecklenburg-Vorpommern', 'Lower Saxony', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Mecklenburg-Vorpommern', 'Schleswig-Holstein', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Mecklenburg-Vorpommern', 'Brandenburg', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Brandenburg', 'Lower Saxony', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Brandenburg', 'Mecklenburg-Vorpommern', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Brandenburg', 'Saxony-Anhalt', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Saxony-Anhalt', 'Lower Saxony', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Saxony-Anhalt', 'Brandenburg', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Saxony-Anhalt', 'Thuringia', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Thuringia', 'Lower Saxony', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Thuringia', 'Saxony-Anhalt', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Thuringia', 'Hesse', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Hesse', 'Lower Saxony', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Hesse', 'Thuringia', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Hesse', 'North Rhine-Westphalia', 'borders', 'P47'), ('North Rhine-Westphalia', 'Lower Saxony', 'borders', 'P47'), ('North Rhine-Westphalia', 'Hesse', 'borders', 'P47'), ('East Frisia', 'North Sea', 'on the coast of', 'P206')]","['Lower Saxony (German: Niedersachsen [ˈniːdɐzaksən], Low German: Neddersassen) is a German state (Bundesland) situated in northwestern Germany and is second in area, with 47,624 square kilometres (18,388 sq mi), and fourth in population (8 million) among the sixteen Länder of Germany.', 'In rural areas Northern Low Saxon, a dialect of Low German, and Saterland Frisian, a variety of Frisian, are still spoken, but the number of speakers is declining.', 'Lower Saxony borders on (from north and clockwise) the North Sea, the states of Schleswig-Holstein, Hamburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Brandenburg, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia, Hesse and North Rhine-Westphalia, and the Netherlands.', 'Furthermore, the state of Bremen forms two enclaves within Lower Saxony, one being the city of Bremen, the other, its seaport city of Bremerhaven.', 'In fact, Lower Saxony borders more neighbours than any other single Bundesland.', ""The state's principal cities include the state capital Hanover, Braunschweig (Brunswick), Lüneburg, Osnabrück, Oldenburg, Hildesheim, Wolfenbüttel, Wolfsburg and Göttingen."", 'The northwestern area of Lower Saxony, which lies on the coast of the North Sea, is called East Frisia and the seven East Frisian Islands offshore are popular with tourists.', 'In the extreme west of Lower Saxony is the Emsland, a traditionally poor and sparsely populated area, once dominated by inaccessible swamps.', 'The northern half of Lower Saxony, also known as the North German Plains, is almost invariably flat except for the gentle hills around the Bremen geestland.', 'Towards the south and southwest lie the northern parts of the German Central Uplands: the Weser Uplands and the Harz mountains.', 'Between these two lie the Lower Saxon Hills, a range of low ridges.', 'Thus, Lower Saxony is the only Bundesland that encompasses both maritime and mountainous areas.', ""Lower Saxony's major cities and economic centres are mainly situated in its central and southern parts, namely Hanover, Braunschweig, Osnabrück, Wolfsburg, Salzgitter, Hildesheim and Göttingen."", 'Oldenburg, near the northwestern coastline, is another economic centre.', 'The region in the northeast is called the Lüneburg Heath (Lüneburger Heide), the largest heathland area of Germany and in medieval times wealthy due to salt mining and salt trade, as well as to a lesser degree the exploitation of its peat bogs up until about the 1960s.', 'To the north, the Elbe river separates Lower Saxony from Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Brandenburg.', 'The banks just south of the Elbe are known as Altes Land (Old Country).', ""Due to its gentle local climate and fertile soil it is the state's largest area of fruit farming, its chief produce being apples."", ""Most of the state's territory was part of the historic Kingdom of Hanover;

"Mozambique (/moʊzæmˈbiːk/ or /mɔːzæmˈbiːk/), officially the Republic of Mozambique (Portuguese: Moçambique or República de Moçambique, [rɛˈpublikɐ dɨ musɐ̃ˈbikɨ]), is a country in Southeast Africa bordered by the Indian Ocean to the east, Tanzania to the north, Malawi and Zambia to the northwest, Zimbabwe to the west, and Swaziland and South Africa to the southwest. It is separated from Madagascar by the Mozambique Channel to the east. The capital and largest city is Maputo (known as ""Lourenço Marques"" before independence). Between the 1st and 5th centuries AD, Bantu-speaking peoples migrated from farther north and west. Swahili, and later Arab, commercial ports existed along the coasts until the arrival of Europeans. The area was explored by Vasco da Gama in 1498 and colonized by Portugal from 1505. After over four centuries of Portuguese rule, Mozambique gained independence in 1975, becoming the People's Republic of Mozambique shortly thereafter. After only two years of independence, the country descended into an intense and protracted civil war lasting from 1977 to 1992. In 1994, Mozambique held its first multiparty elections and has remained a relatively stable presidential republic. Mozambique is one of the poorest and most underdeveloped countries in the world. Mozambique is endowed with rich and extensive natural resources. The country's economy is based largely on agriculture, but industry, mainly food and beverages, chemical manufacturing, aluminium and petroleum production, is growing. The country's tourism sector is also growing. South Africa is Mozambique's main trading partner and source of foreign direct investment. Belgium, Brazil, Portugal, and Spain are also among the country's most important economic partners. Since 2001, Mozambique's annual average GDP growth has been among the world's highest. However, the country ranks among the lowest in GDP per capita, human development, measures of inequality, and average life expectancy. The only official language of Mozambique is Portuguese, which is spoken mostly as a second language by about half of the population. Common native languages include Makhuwa, Sena, and Swahili. The country's population of around 24 million is composed overwhelmingly of Bantu people. The largest religion in Mozambique is Christianity, with significant minorities following Islam and African traditional religions. Mozambique is a member of the African Union, the Commonwealth of Nations, the Community of Portuguese Language Countries, the Latin Union, the Non-Aligned Movement and the Southern African Development

Flowing entirely in the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for 2,320 miles (3,730 km) to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 US states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi ranks as the fourth longest and ninth largest river in the world by discharge. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Native Americans long lived along the Mississippi River and its tributaries. Most were hunter-gatherers or herders, but some, such as the Mound builders, formed prolific agricultural societies. The arrival of Europeans in the 16th century changed the native way of life as first explorers, then settlers, ventured into the basin in increasing numbers. The river served first as a barrier – forming borders for New Spain, New France, and the early United States – then as a vital transportation artery and communications link. In the 19th century, during the height of the ideology of Manifest Destiny, the Mississippi and several western tributaries, most notably the Missouri, formed pathways for the western expansion of the United States. Formed from thick layers of the river's silt deposits, the Mississippi Embayment is one of the most fertile agricultural regions of the country, which resulted in the river's storied steamboat era. During the American Civil War, the Mississippi's capture by Union forces marked a turning point towards victory because of the river's importance as a route of trade and travel, not least to the Confederacy. Because of substantial growth of cities and the larger ships and barges that supplanted riverboats, the first decades of the 20th century saw the construction of massive engineering works such as levees, locks and dams, often built in combination. Since modern development of the basin began, the Mississippi has also seen its share of pollution and environmental problems – most notably large volumes of agricultural runoff, which has led to the Gulf of Mexico dead zone off the Delta. In recent years, the river has shown a steady shift towards the Atchafalaya River channel in the Delta; a course change would be an economic disaster for the port city of New Orleans.","[('Minnesota', 'Wisconsin', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Minnesota', 'Iowa', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Wisconsin', 'Minnesota', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Wisconsin', 'Iowa', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Wisconsin', 'Illinois', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Iowa', 'Minnesota', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Iowa', 'Wisconsin', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Iowa', 'Illinois', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Iowa', 'Missouri', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Illinois', 'Wisconsin', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Illinois', 'Iowa', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Illinois', 'Missouri', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Illinois', 'Kentucky', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Missouri', 'Iowa', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Missouri', 'Illinois', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Missouri', 'Kentucky', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Missouri', 'Tennessee', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Missouri', 'Arkansas', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Kentucky', 'Illinois', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Kentucky', 'Missouri', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Kentucky', 'Tennessee', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Tennessee', 'Missouri', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Tennessee', 'Kentucky', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Tennessee', 'Arkansas', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Arkansas', 'Missouri', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Arkansas', 'Tennessee', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Arkansas', 'Louisiana', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Louisiana', 'Arkansas', 'borders', 'P47')]","['The Mississippi River is the chief river of the largest drainage system on the North American continent.', 'Flowing entirely in the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for 2,320 miles (3,730 km) to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico.', ""With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 US states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains."", 'The Mississippi ranks as the fourth longest and ninth largest river in the world by discharge.', 'The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana.', 'Native Americans long lived along the Mississippi River and its tributaries.', 'Most were hunter-gatherers or herders, but some, such as the Mound builders, formed prolific agricultural societies.', 'The arrival of Europeans in the 16th century changed the native way of life as first explorers, then settlers, ventured into the basin in increasing numbers.', 'The river served first as a barrier – forming borders for New Spain, New France, and the early United States – then as a vital transportation artery and communications link.', 'In the 19th century, during the height of the ideology of Manifest Destiny, the Mississippi and several western tributaries, most notably the Missouri, formed pathways for the western expansion of the United States.', ""Formed from thick layers of the river's silt deposits, the Mississippi Embayment is one of the most fertile agricultural regions of the country, which resulted in the river's storied steamboat era."", ""During the American Civil War, the Mississippi's capture by Union forces marked a turning point towards victory because of the river's importance as a route of trade and travel, not least to the Confederacy."", 'Because of substantial growth of cities and the larger ships and barges that supplanted riverboats, the first decades of the 20th century saw the construction of massive engineering works such as levees, locks and dams, often built in combination.', 'Since modern development of the basin began, the Mississippi has also seen its share of pollution and environmental problems – most notably large volumes of agricultural runoff, which has led to the Gulf of Mexico dead zone off the Delta.', 'In recent years, the river has shown a steady shift towards the Atchafalaya River channel in the Delta; a course change would be an economic disaster for the port city of New Orleans.']",15,247,40

It has a coast on the Adriatic Sea to the south-west and is bordered by Croatia to the west, Bosnia and Herzegovina to the northwest, Serbia to the northeast, and Albania to the south-east. Its capital and largest city is Podgorica, while Cetinje is designated as the Prijestonica, meaning the former Royal Capital City. In the 9th century, there were three principalities on the territory of Montenegro: Duklja, roughly corresponding to the southern half, Travunia, the west, and Rascia, the north. In 1042, archon Stefan Vojislav led a revolt that resulted in the independence of Duklja and the establishment of the Vojislavljević dynasty. Duklja reached its zenith under Vojislav's son, Mihailo (1046–81), and his grandson Bodin (1081–1101). By the 13th century, Zeta had replaced Duklja when referring to the realm. In the late 14th century, southern Montenegro (Zeta) came under the rule of the Balšić noble family, then the Crnojević noble family, and by the 15th century, Zeta was more often referred to as Crna Gora (Venetian: monte negro). Large portions fell under the control of the Ottoman Empire from 1496 to 1878. Parts were controlled by Venice. From 1515 until 1851 the prince-bishops (vladikas) of Cetinje were the rulers. The House of Petrović-Njegoš ruled until 1918. From 1918, it was a part of Yugoslavia. On the basis of an independence referendum held on 21 May 2006, Montenegro declared independence on 3 June of that year. Classified by the World Bank as an upper middle-income country, Montenegro is a member of the UN, the World Trade Organization, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the Council of Europe, the Central European Free Trade Agreement and a founding member of the Union for the Mediterranean.

"The Han dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD) of ancient China was the second imperial dynasty of China, following the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC). It was divided into the periods of Former Han (202 BC – 9 AD) and Later Han (25–220 AD), briefly interrupted by the Xin dynasty (9–23 AD) of Wang Mang. The capital of Western Han was Chang'an, and the capital of Eastern Han was Luoyang. The emperor headed the government, promulgating all written laws, serving as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and presiding as the chief executive official. He appointed all government officials who earned a salary of 600 bushels of grain or more (though these salaries were largely paid in coin cash) with the help of advisors who reviewed each nominee. The empress dowager could either be the emperor's actual or symbolic mother, and was in practice more powerful than the emperor, as she could override his decisions. The emperor's executive powers could also be practiced by any official upon whom he bestowed the Staff of Authority. These powers included the right to execute criminals without the imperial court's permission. Near the beginning of the dynasty, semi-autonomous regional kings rivaled the emperor's authority. This autonomy was greatly diminished when the imperial court enacted reforms following the threats to central control like the Rebellion of the Seven States. The End of the Han dynasty came about during a time of civil, military and religious upheaval, which resulted in the period of Three Kingdoms. The highest officials in the central bureaucracy, who provided advisory, censorial, executive, and judicial roles in governing the empire, consisted of cabinet members known as the Excellencies, heads of large specialized ministries known as the Nine Ministers, and various metropolitan officials of the capital region. Distinguished salary-ranks were granted to officials in the bureaucracy, nobles of the imperial family, concubines of the harem, and military officers of the armed forces. Local government divisions, in descending order by size, were the province, commandery, county, and district. Local fiefs of the nobility included the kingdom, which was modeled largely upon the regular commandery, as well as the marquessate, modelled largely upon the regular county. Although the central government's monopolies on salt, iron, and liquor eventually failed and were relinquished back to private production, the government successfully nationalized the issuing of coin currency through its imperial mint, which lasted from 113 BC until the end of the dynasty.

"A border blaster is a broadcast station that, though not licensed as an external service, is, in practice, used to target another country. The term ""border blaster"" is of North American origin, and usually associated with Mexican AM stations covering large parts of the United States and United States border AM stations covering large parts of Canada. Conceptually similar European broadcasting included some pre–World War II broadcasting towards the United Kingdom, ""radio périphérique"" around France and the US government funded propaganda station Radio Free Europe targeting eastern Europe. With broadcasting signals far more powerful than U.S. stations, the Mexican border blasters could be heard over large areas of the U.S. from the 1940s to the 1970s, often to the great irritation of American radio stations, whose signals could be overpowered by their Mexican counterparts. These are also sometimes referred to as X stations for their call letters: Mexico assigns callsigns beginning with XE or XH to broadcast stations. On November 9, 1972 in Washington, D.C., the United States and Mexico signed an ""Agreement Concerning Frequency Modulation Broadcasting in the 87.5 to 108 MHz Band"". Since then, in the FM band power levels and frequency assignments have been set by mutual agreement between the two countries. AM radio border blasters still exist, though they are largely ignored due to the decline of AM radio in the U.S. and in Mexico. There are several such stations licensed by Mexico's Secretariat of Communications and Transportation using transmitters with an effective radiated power similar to those of major licensed commercial stations located within the USA. In 1973 the border blaster XERB became famous when George Lucas featured the station as the source for the musical soundtrack of his motion picture American Graffiti.[citation needed]","[('American', 'Mexican', 'border', 'P47'), ('American', 'Mexican', 'border', 'P47'), ('American', 'Canada', 'border', 'P47'), ('American', 'Canada', 'border', 'P47'), ('Mexican', 'American', 'border', 'P47'), ('Mexican', 'American', 'border', 'P47'), ('Mexican', 'United States', 'border', 'P47'), ('Mexican', 'United States', 'border', 'P47'), ('Mexican', 'United States', 'border', 'P47'), ('Mexican', 'United States', 'border', 'P47'), ('United States', 'Mexican', 'border', 'P47'), ('United States', 'Mexican', 'border', 'P47'), ('United States', 'Canada', 'border', 'P47'), ('United States', 'Canada', 'border', 'P47'), ('United States', 'Mexican', 'border', 'P47'), ('United States', 'Mexican', 'border', 'P47'), ('United States', 'Canada', 'border', 'P47'), ('United States', 'Canada', 'border', 'P47'), ('Canada', 'American', 'border', 'P47'), ('Canada', 'American', 'border', 'P47'), ('Canada', 'United States', 'border', 'P47'), ('Canada', 'United States', 'border', 'P47'), ('Canada', 'United States', 'border', 'P47'), ('Canada', 'United States', 'border', 'P47')]","['A border blaster is a broadcast station that, though not licensed as an external service, is, in practice, used to target another country.', 'The term ""border blaster"" is of North American origin, and usually associated with Mexican AM stations covering large parts of the United States and United States border AM stations covering large parts of Canada.', 'Conceptually similar European broadcasting included some pre–World War II broadcasting towards the United Kingdom, ""radio périphérique"" around France and the US government funded propaganda station Radio Free Europe targeting eastern Europe.', 'With broadcasting signals far more powerful than U.S. stations, the Mexican border blasters could be heard over large areas of the U.S. from the 1940s to the 1970s, often to the great irritation of American radio stations, whose signals could be overpowered by their Mexican counterparts.', 'These are also sometimes referred to as X stations for their call letters: Mexico assigns callsigns beginning with XE or XH to broadcast stations.', 'On November 9, 1972 in Washington, D.C., the United States and Mexico signed an ""Agreement Concerning Frequency Modulation Broadcasting in the 87.5 to 108 MHz Band"".', 'Since then, in the FM band power levels and frequency assignments have been set by mutual agreement between the two countries.', 'AM radio border blasters still exist, though they are largely ignored due to the decline of AM radio in the U.S. and in Mexico.', ""There are several such stations licensed by Mexico's Secretariat of Communications and Transportation using transmitters with an effective radiated power similar to those of major licensed commercial stations located within the USA."", 'In 1973 the border blaster XERB became famous when George Lucas featured the station as the source for the musical soundtrack of his motion picture American Graffiti.', '[citation needed]']",11,288,46

"Consort Chen Farong (陳法容) was an imperial consort during the Chinese dynasty Liu Song. She was a concubine of Emperor Ming, and during his reign, she carried the rank of Zhaohua (昭華), the sixth highest rank for Liu Song imperial consorts. Consort Chen was from the Liu Song capital Jiankang, and she was regarded as the mother of Emperor Ming's son Liu Zhun (later Emperor Shun), born in 467, but whether she was his biological mother is a matter of historical dispute. Historical accounts, written during the succeeding Southern Qi Dynasty, indicate that Emperor Ming was impotent, and that although he had 12 sons, those were the results of his having seized his brothers' pregnant concubines and kept the children if they bore males, or his having had his concubines have sexual relations with others. (However, the fact that his wife Empress Wang Zhenfeng had two daughters, although no sons, may argue against such allegations, because it appeared rather unlikely that Emperor Ming would do this over female children—indeed, the allegations stated that he would only do this if his brothers' concubines bore males—or that the morally upright Empress Wang would engage in sexual relations with others, thus suggesting that the allegations were made to delegitimize Emperor Ming's sons Emperor Houfei and Emperor Shun vis-à-vis Southern Qi.) Those same accounts indicate that Liu Zhun was actually the biological son of Emperor Ming's brother Liu Xiufan (劉休範) the Prince of Guiyang and one of Liu Xiufan's concubines, and that Emperor Ming had her raise Liu Zhun. Emperor Ming died in 472, and was succeeded by his son Liu Yu (Emperor Houfei). Because Liu Zhun, as the emperor's brother, carried the title of Prince of Ancheng, Consort Chen was honored as the Princess Dowager of Ancheng. After the impulsive and violent Emperor Houfei was assassinated in 477, the general Xiao Daocheng effectively took over the government and made Liu Zhun a puppet emperor. Consort Chen, as the emperor's mother, was honored as ""Consort Dowager"" (皇太妃) but not as empress dowager—that title belonged to Emperor Ming's wife Empress Wang. Xiao forced Emperor Shun to yield the throne to him in 479, ending Liu Song and starting Southern Qi, and Emperor Shun was created the Prince of Ruyin.

"Kortrijk (in English also Courtrai or Courtray; official name in Dutch: Kortrijk, [ˈkɔrtrɛi̯k]; West Flemish: Kortryk or Kortrik, French: Courtrai, [kuʁtʁɛ]; Latin: Cortoriacum) is a Belgian city and municipality located in the Flemish province West Flanders. It is the capital and largest city of the arrondissement of Kortrijk, which is both a judicial and an administrative arrondissement.The wider municipality comprises the city of Kortrijk proper and the villages of Aalbeke, Bellegem, Bissegem, Heule, Kooigem, Marke, and Rollegem. Kortrijk is part of the cross-border Eurometropolis Lille-Kortrijk-Tournai (metropolitan area), which had 2,155,161 residents in 2008. The city is situated on the Leie, 42 km (26 mi) southwest of Ghent and 25 km (16 mi) northeast of Lille in France. Both Kortrijk and Lille are part of the same transnational Eurodistrict urban agglomeration with around 1,900,000 inhabitants. As the biggest city of southern West Flanders, Kortrijk has many schools, hospitals and shopping streets. Kortrijk originated from a Gallo-Roman town, called Cortoriacum at a crossroads near the Leie river and two Roman roads. During the Middle Ages, Kortrijk grew significantly thanks to the flax and wool industry with France and England and became one of the biggest and richest cities in Flanders. The city is often referred to as City of Groeninge or City of the Golden Spurs, referring to the Battle of Courtrai or the Battle of the Golden Spurs which took place on 11 July 1302 on the Fields of Groeninge in Kortrijk. In 1820, the Treaty of Kortrijk was signed, which laid out the current borders between France and Belgium. Throughout the 19th and 20th century, Kortrijk became a center of the flax industry and remains an important region within the Belgian textile industry today. Today, Kortrijk is the largest city in southern West-Flanders with several hospitals, colleges and a university. Kortrijk was the first city in Belgium with a pedestrian shopping street, called the Korte Steenstraat. Nowadays, a big part of the historical city center is a complete pedestrian area with lots of shops and a covered shopping mall called K, as well as many restaurants and bars. Another shopping mall is located near the northern edge of the city: Ring Shopping Kortrijk Noord.","[('Kortrijk', 'West Flemish', 'city', 'P131'), ('Kortrijk', 'West Flanders', 'city', 'P131'), ('Courtrai', 'West Flemish', 'city', 'P131'), ('Courtrai', 'West Flanders', 'city', 'P131'), ('Courtray', 'West Flemish', 'city', 'P131'), ('Courtray', 'West Flanders', 'city', 'P131'), ('Kortrijk', 'West Flemish', 'city', 'P131'), ('Kortrijk', 'West Flanders', 'city', 'P131'), ('West Flemish', 'Flemish', 'city', 'P131'), ('Courtrai', 'West Flemish', 'city', 'P131'), ('Courtrai', 'West Flanders', 'city', 'P131'), ('Flemish', 'Belgian', 'city', 'P131'), ('West Flanders', 'Flemish', 'city', 'P131'), ('Heule', 'Kortrijk', 'city', 'P131'), ('Heule', 'Kortrijk', 'city', 'P131'), ('Heule', 'Kortrijk', 'city', 'P131'), ('Heule', 'Kortrijk', 'city', 'P131'), ('Heule', 'It', 'city', 'P131'), ('Heule', 'It', 'city', 'P131'), ('Kortrijk', 'West Flanders', 'city', 'P131'), ('France', 'Belgium', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Belgium', 'France', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Kortrijk', 'West-Flanders', 'city', 'P131')]","['Kortrijk (in English also Courtrai or Courtray; official name in Dutch: Kortrijk, [ˈkɔrtrɛi̯k]; West Flemish: Kortryk or Kortrik, French: Courtrai, [kuʁtʁɛ]; Latin: Cortoriacum) is a Belgian city and municipality located in the Flemish province West Flanders.', 'It is the capital and largest city of the arrondissement of Kortrijk, which is both a judicial and an administrative arrondissement.The wider municipality comprises the city of Kortrijk proper and the villages of Aalbeke, Bellegem, Bissegem, Heule, Kooigem, Marke, and Rollegem.', 'Kortrijk is part of the cross-border Eurometropolis Lille-Kortrijk-Tournai (metropolitan area), which had 2,155,161 residents in 2008.', 'The city is situated on the Leie, 42 km (26 mi) southwest of Ghent and 25 km (16 mi) northeast of Lille in France.', 'Both Kortrijk and Lille are part of the same transnational Eurodistrict urban agglomeration with around 1,900,000 inhabitants.', 'As the biggest city of southern West Flanders, Kortrijk has many schools, hospitals and shopping streets.', 'Kortrijk originated from a Gallo-Roman town, called Cortoriacum at a crossroads near the Leie river and two Roman roads.', 'During the Middle Ages, Kortrijk grew significantly thanks to the flax and wool industry with France and England and became one of the biggest and richest cities in Flanders.', 'The city is often referred to as City of Groeninge or City of the Golden Spurs, referring to the Battle of Courtrai or the Battle of the Golden Spurs which took place on 11 July 1302 on the Fields of Groeninge in Kortrijk.', 'In 1820, the Treaty of Kortrijk was signed, which laid out the current borders between France and Belgium.', 'Throughout the 19th and 20th century, Kortrijk became a center of the flax industry and remains an important region within the Belgian textile industry today.', 'Today, Kortrijk is the largest city in southern West-Flanders with several hospitals, colleges and a university.', 'Kortrijk was the first city in Belgium with a pedestrian shopping street, called the Korte Steenstraat.', 'Nowadays, a big part of the historical city center is a complete pedestrian area with lots of shops and a covered shopping mall called K, as well as many restaurants and bars.', 'Another shopping mall is located near the northern edge of the city: Ring Shopping Kortrijk Noord.']",15,278,43
"The Brazilian Court Hotel is a historic luxury hotel in Palm Beach, Florida, United States which opened on New Year's Day in 1926. The National Trust for Historic Preservation accepted The Brazilian Court Hotel to be part of the Historic Hotels of America. In 1924 and 1925 two New York investors, Joseph D'Esterre and Stanley Paschal assembled the site of The Brazilian Court, at that time occupied by a few bungalows. They retained a rising young designer with whom Paschal had worked on apartment house projects in New York – Rosario Candela. Candela, born in Sicily, arrived in the United States in the 1910s speaking only a few words of English. But by 1925 he was one of the top apartment house designers in New York, with a score of luxury buildings on Park and Fifth Avenues to his credit. Candela used a Mediterranean design for The Brazilian Court, with tinted, rough stucco, classical details and tiled roofs. Candela developed a simple courtyard model which emphasized the inner face of the building, rather than the street façade. It was organized as an apartment hotel, with small kitchens for the meals that guests chose not to take outside. In 2003, Obadon Hotels purchased The Brazilian Court, and renovated it from the formal setting of the 1920s to a more cosmopolitan style. In doing so, the kitchenettes were removed, and in their place opened a restaurant, Cafe Boulud, under the James Beard Award nominee, Chef Daniel Boulud. The hotel is located at 301 Australian Avenue. It is a National Trust for Historic Preservation and a Leading Hotel of the World.

"Angrogna is a comune (municipality) in the Province of Turin in the Italian region Piedmont, located about 45 kilometres (28 mi) southwest of Turin. Angrogna borders the following municipalities: Perrero, Prali, Pramollo, San Germano Chisone, Prarostino, Villar Pellice, Bricherasio, Torre Pellice, and Luserna San Giovanni. The valley of Angrogna, Val di Angrogna, situated in the Cottian Alps between Piedmont and France has historic significance for the Waldensian Church. A narrow Alpine valley starting in Val Pellice, the valley of Angrogna ends at the village of Pra del Torno which was the location of a Waldensian mission centre during The Middle Ages. Due to its narrowness, the valley was a military and religious refuge for the Waldensians and Pra del Torno were the centre of Waldensian resistance from the 13th to the 18th centuries. As evidence of their persecutions, there is still a sort of catacomb located near the village of San Lorenzo. In pre-Reformation times Waldensian missionaries were trained in a college at Pra del Torno by 'barbes', their pastors, to work as traders spreading their message across Europe. The ruins of this college still exist. There are both Catholic and Waldensian churches today situated at Pra del Torno, as well as in a number of other villages in the valley. Angrona was selected as the Waldensian refuge from Papal armies under Papal legate, Cataneo in 1488. Cataneo was charged by a Papal Bull to destroy the 'heretic' populations of the Waldensian valleys but the Waldensians defenders were able to repel the Papal troops' just outside Pra del Torno and protect their main population in the village from massacre. In 1532, at Chanforan in Angrogna, a Waldensian synod of churches in France, Calabria and Apulia took the decision that the Waldensian Church should join the Protestant Reformation which their doctrines had prefigured. The Waldensians in Angrogna suffered fierce persecutions throughout the 17th century but were supported by Oliver Cromwell and William of Orange. In 1686, Vittorio Amedeo II, in accordance with the policy of Louis XIV of France, began the systematic expulsion of the Waldensian valleys. Local troops destroyed the houses of Waldensians and their land in the valley was expropriated and sold to Catholics coming from elsewhere in Piedmont. After reconciling with Victor Amadeus, the Waldensians returned to their land and homes in the valley. Charles Albert of Savoy gave the Waldenses freedom to worship, in February 1848. In the nineteenth century, British supporters of the Waldensians, who funded the Waldensian headquarters in nearby Torre Pellice founded a primary school for Waldensian children living in Angrogna.","[('Angrogna', 'comune', 'is a', 'P31'), ('Angrogna', 'Perrero', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Angrogna', 'Prali', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Angrogna', 'Villar Pellice', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Angrogna', 'Bricherasio', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Angrogna', 'Torre Pellice', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Angrogna', 'Luserna San Giovanni', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Perrero', 'Angrogna', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Perrero', 'Prali', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Perrero', 'Villar Pellice', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Prali', 'Angrogna', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Prali', 'Perrero', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Prali', 'Villar Pellice', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Villar Pellice', 'Angrogna', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Villar Pellice', 'Perrero', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Villar Pellice', 'Prali', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Villar Pellice', 'Torre Pellice', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Bricherasio', 'Angrogna', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Bricherasio', 'Luserna San Giovanni', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Torre Pellice', 'Angrogna', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Torre Pellice', 'Villar Pellice', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Torre Pellice', 'Luserna San Giovanni', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Luserna San Giovanni', 'Angrogna', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Luserna San Giovanni', 'Bricherasio', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Luserna San Giovanni', 'Torre Pellice', 'borders', 'P47')]","['Angrogna is a comune (municipality) in the Province of Turin in the Italian region Piedmont, located about 45 kilometres (28 mi) southwest of Turin.', 'Angrogna borders the following municipalities: Perrero, Prali, Pramollo, San Germano Chisone, Prarostino, Villar Pellice, Bricherasio, Torre Pellice, and Luserna San Giovanni.', 'The valley of Angrogna, Val di Angrogna, situated in the Cottian Alps between Piedmont and France has historic significance for the Waldensian Church.', 'A narrow Alpine valley starting in Val Pellice, the valley of Angrogna ends at the village of Pra del Torno which was the location of a Waldensian mission centre during The Middle Ages.', 'Due to its narrowness, the valley was a military and religious refuge for the Waldensians and Pra del Torno were the centre of Waldensian resistance from the 13th to the 18th centuries.', 'As evidence of their persecutions, there is still a sort of catacomb located near the village of San Lorenzo.', ""In pre-Reformation times Waldensian missionaries were trained in a college at Pra del Torno by 'barbes', their pastors, to work as traders spreading their message across Europe."", 'The ruins of this college still exist.', 'There are both Catholic and Waldensian churches today situated at Pra del Torno, as well as in a number of other villages in the valley.', 'Angrona was selected as the Waldensian refuge from Papal armies under Papal legate, Cataneo in 1488.', ""Cataneo was charged by a Papal Bull to destroy the 'heretic' populations of the Waldensian valleys but the Waldensians defenders were able to repel the Papal troops' just outside Pra del Torno and protect their main population in the village from massacre."", 'In 1532, at Chanforan in Angrogna, a Waldensian synod of churches in France, Calabria and Apulia took the decision that the Waldensian Church should join the Protestant Reformation which their doctrines had prefigured.', 'The Waldensians in Angrogna suffered fierce persecutions throughout the 17th century but were supported by Oliver Cromwell and William of Orange.', 'In 1686, Vittorio Amedeo II, in accordance with the policy of Louis XIV of France, began the systematic expulsion of the Waldensian valleys.', 'Local troops destroyed the houses of Waldensians and their land in the valley was expropriated and sold to Catholics coming from elsewhere in Piedmont.', 'After reconciling with Victor Amadeus, the Waldensians returned to their land and homes in the valley.', 'Charles Albert of Savoy gave the Waldenses freedom to worship, in February 1848.', 'In the nineteenth century, British supporters of the Waldensians, who funded the Waldensian headquarters in nearby Torre Pellice founded a primary school for Waldensian children living in Angrogna.']",18,256,42
"Huánuco is a region in central Peru. It is bordered by the La Libertad, San Martín, Loreto and Ucayali regions in the north, the Ucayali Region in the east, the Pasco Region in the south and the Lima and Ancash regions in the west. Its capital is the city Huánuco. Huánuco has a rough topography comprising parts of the Sierra and the High Jungle (mountain rim) regions. Being equidistant from the north and the south of the country, it has the privilege of having a mild weather with an average annual temperature of 20°C (68°F). This region is important for its geographical location, history, and for the richness of its land, where the presence of man goes back to ancient times. El Hombre de Lauricocha (Man of Lauricocha) is among the most distinctive examples, dating from 10,000 BC, as well as Kotosh, where vestiges of the oldest settlement in the Americas (4200 BC) took place.

It operates 128 motor trams and 74 trailers on 9 tram routes, as well as 99 buses on a total of 13 bus routes. These are kept operating by 1200 employees. The BVB jointly operates the Basel tram network with Baselland Transport AG (BLT), owned by the adjoining canton of Basel-Land. Whilst the green colored BVB tends to operate the shorter urban services, its tram routes do extend beyond the inner city into Basel-Land. Likewise the yellow BLT trams operate into the city centre. Both are part of the integrated fare network Tarifverbund Nordwestschweiz (TNW), which in itself is part of the three countries-integrated fare network triregio.

"The Karnataka Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prohibition of Transfer of Certain Lands) Act, 1978 (Karnataka Act 2 of 1979) or PTCL is a statute of Karnataka. This law which was introduced in 1978 is retrospective in nature and is considered an ex post facto law. Currently over 10000 cases are pending before the office of the Deputy Commissioners across the State Karnataka. This law was created as a social welfare Act aiming to protect and provide land for the poor members of the scheduled Tribes and castes. But due to a lack of clarity and understanding between the judiciary and the administration there exists this large number of cases still hanging in the balance. The preamble of the Act reads: The problem lies in the fact that when the grantee goes to sell the land which he is not supposed to, the Govt does not refuse to register this Sale but officially accepts it as a legal sale. Later the grantee goes back to the Govt and claims this land back. The law then says the land has to be returned to the grantee without any compensation.The fact is that the Karnataka Govt does not know what land has been granted or that is which is not granted.1.

(ii) It shall come into force at once. 2.

"Seeta aur Geeta (Hindi: सीता और गीता , translation: Seeta and Geeta) is a 1972 Hindi comedy, drama film starring Hema Malini in a dual role, and directed by Ramesh Sippy. The story is by Salim-Javed and the music by R.D. Burman. The story is about identical twins (played by Hema Malini) who are separated at birth and grow up with different temperaments. The twins then swap places (like The Prince and the Pauper). Hema's two partners in the movie are played by Dharmendra and Sanjeev Kumar. Manorama plays the evil aunt who changes her tune after her arm is twisted (literally). Furthermore, Hema Malini was noted for the novelty of her role as Geeta where she is rambunctious and sometimes violent. This theme has been repeated in other movies before and after. A prior movie on this theme was Ram Aur Shyam starring Dilip Kumar in the leading dual role. Subsequent Hindi remakes of the story have been made, including Jaise Ko Taisa starring Jeetendra, ChaalBaaz starring Sridevi, Kishen Kanhaiya starring Anil Kapoor, Judwaa starring Salman Khan, Duplicate starring Shahrukh Khan, Kuch Khatti Kuch Meethi starring Kajol, in the dual roles. Remakes in other languages include the Telugu film Ganga Manga (1973) and the Tamil film Vani Rani (1974), both starring Vanisri in the dual roles. Hema Malini won her only competitive Filmfare Best Actress Award of her career. P. Vaikunth won the Filmfare Best Cinematographer Award.

"The Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Bosnian: Republika Bosna i Hercegovina, Република Босна и Херцеговина) was the direct legal predecessor to the modern-day state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina existed legally until co-signing the Annex 4 of the Dayton Agreement, containing the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 14 December 1995, but official documents reveal that the state existed up until the end of 1997 when the implementation of the Dayton Agreement was finished and only then it fully came into effect.

"The black-lored babbler or Sharpe's pied-babbler (Turdoides sharpei) is a species of bird in the Leiothrichidae family. It is found in southwestern Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda, and the part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo immediately adjacent to the three last-named countries. This bird was formerly considered the same species as Turdoides melanops of southern Africa, now known as the black-faced babbler. These birds are mostly grey-brown with white mottling, especially on the underparts, that varies according to location and the individual. The population near Nanyuki, Kenya, is darker but can have a pure white chin or entire throat. The combination of pale yellow or white eyes and black lores (the areas between the eye and the bill) separates adults of this species from similar babblers except melanops, though all juvenile babblers have brown eyes. In Kenya, single birds give repeated single or double harsh notes such as waaach or a muffled kurr-ack; pairs or groups give longer phrases in chorus. The tempo is frequently slow for a babbler. They are most vocal in the early morning and late afternoon. Like other Turdoides, it is found low or on the ground in or near dense woody vegetation, including in cultivated areas. Kenyan birds forage in bushes and tall grass. They are ""restless, noisy, and suspicious"" and ""typical gregarious babblers"".

"The border between Norway and Russia (Norwegian: Russergrensen, Russian: Российско-норвежская граница) consists of a 195.7-kilometer (121.6 mi) land border between Sør-Varanger, Norway, and Pechengsky District, Russia, and a 23.2-kilometer (14.4 mi) marine border in the Varangerfjord. It further consists of a border between the two countries' exclusive economic zones (EEZ) in the Barents Sea and the Arctic Ocean. Between 1944 and 1991 the border was between Norway and the Soviet Union. There is a single border crossing, on E105, located at Storskog in Norway and Borisoglebsky (Boris Gleb) in Russia. The Norwegian side is patrolled by the Garrison of Sør-Varanger and is under the jurisdiction of the Norwegian Border Commissioner, while the Russian side is patrolled by the Border Guard Service of Russia. Two-thirds of the border follows two rivers, the Pasvikelva and Jakobselva. The border was defined as a march in a treaty in 1326 and separated which parts of the Sami could be taxed by Norway and Russia. The border line was defined by a treaty in 1826 and essentially remains the same border today. In 1920 Petsamo was ceded to Finland and the border became part of the Finland–Norway border. Petsamo was ceded to the Soviet Union in 1944 and the Norway–Soviet Union border was established. During the Cold War, the border was one of two between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Soviet Union, the other being the Soviet Union–Turkey border. From 1991 to 1999 it was the only border between Russia and NATO. It is Norway's youngest unchanged border.

The Lebanese border forms a salient to include the villages of Karha and Knaisse Akkar in the northwest of Akkar District, just west of the Syrian Lake Homs, and again turns to the south-east, cutting across the Orontes (at 34°27′18″N36°29′24″E﻿ / ﻿34.455°N 36.490°E) and the trans-Beqaa road between Qaa and Al-Qusayr (at 34°25′18″N36°32′36″E﻿ / ﻿34.4217°N 36.5433°E), reaching the Anti-Lebanon mountains at about 34°13′N36°36′E﻿ / ﻿34.22°N 36.60°E.

Consequently, the predominant direction of the state's streamflow is northwest towards the Columbia River and its mouth at the Pacific Ocean.

"Bulgaria is a source and, to a lesser extent, a transit and destination country for women and children who are subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically forced prostitution and men, women, and children subjected to conditions of forced labor. Bulgarian women and children are subjected to forced prostitution within the country, particularly in resort areas and border towns, as well as in the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic, Finland, Greece, Italy, Spain, Poland, Switzerland, Turkey, Cyprus, and Macedonia. Ethnic Roma women and children account for approximately 15 percent of Bulgarian trafficking victims. Bulgarian men, women, and children are subjected to conditions of forced labor in Greece, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Some Bulgarian children are forced into street begging and petty theft within Bulgaria and also in Greece and the United Kingdom. The Government of Bulgaria does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. In 2009, Bulgaria amended Section 159 of its criminal code and increased the minimum penalty for trafficking offenses from one year’s imprisonment to two years’ imprisonment. The government investigated trafficking-related complicity among officials at various levels of government, although efforts to prosecute complicit officials remained limited. While Bulgaria continued its overall efforts to assist and protect most victims of trafficking, two victims identified during the year were punished for crimes committed as a direct result of trafficking.","[('Bulgarian', 'Greece', 'border', 'P47'), ('Bulgarian', 'Turkey', 'border', 'P47'), ('Bulgarian', 'Macedonia', 'border', 'P47'), ('Belgium', 'France', 'border', 'P47'), ('Belgium', 'Germany', 'border', 'P47'), ('France', 'Belgium', 'border', 'P47'), ('France', 'Germany', 'border', 'P47'), ('France', 'Italy', 'border', 'P47'), ('France', 'Spain', 'border', 'P47'), ('France', 'Switzerland', 'border', 'P47'), ('Austria', 'Germany', 'border', 'P47'), ('Austria', 'Czech Republic', 'border', 'P47'), ('Austria', 'Italy', 'border', 'P47'), ('Austria', 'Switzerland', 'border', 'P47'), ('Germany', 'Belgium', 'border', 'P47'), ('Germany', 'France', 'border', 'P47'), ('Germany', 'Austria', 'border', 'P47'), ('Germany', 'Czech Republic', 'border', 'P47'), ('Germany', 'Poland', 'border', 'P47'), ('Germany', 'Switzerland', 'border', 'P47'), ('Czech Republic', 'Austria', 'border', 'P47'), ('Czech Republic', 'Germany', 'border', 'P47'), ('Czech Republic', 'Poland', 'border', 'P47'), ('Greece', 'Bulgarian', 'border', 'P47'), ('Greece', 'Turkey', 'border', 'P47'), ('Greece', 'Macedonia', 'border', 'P47'), ('Italy', 'France', 'border', 'P47'), ('Italy', 'Austria', 'border', 'P47'), ('Italy', 'Switzerland', 'border', 'P47'), ('Spain', 'France', 'border', 'P47'), ('Poland', 'Germany', 'border', 'P47'), ('Poland', 'Czech Republic', 'border', 'P47'), ('Switzerland', 'France', 'border', 'P47'), ('Switzerland', 'Austria', 'border', 'P47'), ('Switzerland', 'Germany', 'border', 'P47'), ('Switzerland', 'Italy', 'border', 'P47'), ('Turkey', 'Bulgarian', 'border', 'P47'), ('Turkey', 'Greece', 'border', 'P47'), ('Macedonia', 'Bulgarian', 'border', 'P47'), ('Macedonia', 'Greece', 'border', 'P47')]","['Bulgaria is a source and, to a lesser extent, a transit and destination country for women and children who are subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically forced prostitution and men, women, and children subjected to conditions of forced labor.', 'Bulgarian women and children are subjected to forced prostitution within the country, particularly in resort areas and border towns, as well as in the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic, Finland, Greece, Italy, Spain, Poland, Switzerland, Turkey, Cyprus, and Macedonia.', 'Ethnic Roma women and children account for approximately 15 percent of Bulgarian trafficking victims.', 'Bulgarian men, women, and children are subjected to conditions of forced labor in Greece, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom.', 'Some Bulgarian children are forced into street begging and petty theft within Bulgaria and also in Greece and the United Kingdom.', 'The Government of Bulgaria does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so.', 'In 2009, Bulgaria amended Section 159 of its criminal code and increased the minimum penalty for trafficking offenses from one year’s imprisonment to two years’ imprisonment.', 'The government investigated trafficking-related complicity among officials at various levels of government, although efforts to prosecute complicit officials remained limited.', 'While Bulgaria continued its overall efforts to assist and protect most victims of trafficking, two victims identified during the year were punished for crimes committed as a direct result of trafficking.']",9,301,42
"The National Basketball Association's first overall pick is the player who is selected first among all eligible draftees by a team during the annual National Basketball Association (NBA) Draft. The first pick is awarded to the team that wins the NBA Draft Lottery; in most cases, that team had a losing record in the previous season. The team with the first pick attracts significant media attention, as does the player who is selected with that pick. Eleven first picks have won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award: Oscar Robertson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (record six-time winner), Bill Walton, Magic Johnson (three-time winner), Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson, Shaquille O'Neal, Allen Iverson, Tim Duncan (two-time winner), LeBron James (four-time winner), and Derrick Rose (youngest winner). Since the advent of the draft lottery in 1985, only six number one overall picks have won an NBA title. They are David Robinson, Shaquille O'Neal, Glenn Robinson, Tim Duncan, LeBron James, and Andrew Bogut. China's Yao Ming (2002) and Italy's Andrea Bargnani (2006) are the only two players without competitive experience in the United States to be drafted first overall. Ten other international players with U.S. college experience have been drafted first overall—Mychal Thompson (Bahamas) in 1978, Hakeem Olajuwon (Nigeria) in 1984, Patrick Ewing (Jamaica) in 1985, Tim Duncan (U.S. Virgin Islands) in 1997, Michael Olowokandi (Nigeria) in 1998, Andrew Bogut (Australia) in 2005, Kyrie Irving (Australia) in 2011, Anthony Bennett (Canada) in 2013, Andrew Wiggins (Canada) in 2014, and Karl-Anthony Towns (Dominican Republic) in 2015.

"David Newell was primarily known as an American character actor, whose acting career spanned from the very beginning of the sound film era through the middle of the 1950s. He made his film debut in a featured role in The Hole in the Wall, a 1929 film starring Edward G. Robinson and Claudette Colbert. Early in his career he had many featured roles, in such films as: RKO's The Runaway Bride in 1929, starring Mary Astor; 1931's Ten Cents a Dance, starring Barbara Stanwyck and directed by Lionel Barrymore; and White Heat in 1934.

After serving as a border between Mexico and Guatemala, the Usumacinta River enters Mexican territory in the state of Tabasco and across the Usumacinta Canyon ecological reserve, forming impressive canyons along its route. Passing the canyon called ""Boca del Cerro"", Tenosique, the Usumacinta goes into the plain of Tabasco. In Tabasco, the Grijalva River flows into the Usumacinta River.

"Gaj's Latin alphabet (Serbo-Croatian: abeceda, latinica, or gajica) is the form of the Latin script used for Serbo-Croatian (Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian, and Montenegrin). It was devised by Croatian linguist Ljudevit Gaj in 1835, based on Jan Hus's Czech alphabet. A slightly reduced version is used as the script of the Slovene language, and a modified version is used for romanization of the Macedonian language. Pavao Ritter Vitezović had proposed an idea for the orthography of the Croatian language, stating that every sound should have only one letter. The Serbian Cyrillic script, which was developed by Serbian linguist Vuk Karadžić and made official in 1818, used a similar concept.

"Stade de Reims ([stɑd də ʁɛ̃s]; commonly referred to as Stade Reims or simply Reims) is a French association football club based in Reims. The club was formed in 1910 under the name Société Sportive du Parc Pommery and currently play in Ligue 1, the top level of French football having achieved promotion to the league following the 2011–12 season. Reims plays its home matches at the Stade Auguste Delaune, a renovation of the old complex located within the city. The team is managed by Olivier Guégan and captained by defender Mickaël Tacalfred. Stade Reims is one of the most successful clubs in French football history having won six Ligue 1 titles, two Coupe de France trophies, and five Trophée des champions titles. The club has also performed well on European level having finished as runners-up in the 1956 and 1959 editions of the European Cup and winning the Latin Cup and Coppa delle Alpi in 1953 and 1977, respectively. However, since the 1980s, Reims have struggled to get back to their zenith. The club hovered between Ligue 2 and the Championnat National for over thirty years after their relegation from the top flight in the 1978–79 season. In 2012, though, they were promoted back to Ligue 1 where they currently remain. Historically, Stade Reims is viewed as a legendary club within French football circles, not only due to its domestic and European accolades, but its charity towards the France national team through the 1940s and 50s, as well. Reims were largely responsible for the first Golden Generation of French football with notable national team members Roger Marche, Raymond Kopa, Just Fontaine, Jean Vincent, Robert Jonquet, Armand Penverne, Dominique Colonna, and Roger Piantoni all playing for Reims during the national team's successful run to the semi-finals at the 1958 FIFA World Cup.","[('Roger Marche', 'Reims', 'team', 'P54'), ('Roger Marche', 'Reims', 'team', 'P54'), ('Roger Marche', 'Reims', 'team', 'P54'), ('Roger Marche', 'Reims', 'team', 'P54'), ('Raymond Kopa', 'Reims', 'team', 'P54'), ('Raymond Kopa', 'Reims', 'team', 'P54'), ('Raymond Kopa', 'Reims', 'team', 'P54'), ('Raymond Kopa', 'Reims', 'team', 'P54'), ('Raymond Kopa', 'Reims', 'team', 'P54'), ('Raymond Kopa', 'Reims', 'team', 'P54'), ('Raymond Kopa', 'Reims', 'team', 'P54'), ('Raymond Kopa', 'Reims', 'team', 'P54'), ('Just Fontaine', 'Reims', 'team', 'P54'), ('Just Fontaine', 'Reims', 'team', 'P54'), ('Just Fontaine', 'Reims', 'team', 'P54'), ('Just Fontaine', 'Reims', 'team', 'P54'), ('Jean Vincent', 'Reims', 'team', 'P54'), ('Jean Vincent', 'Reims', 'team', 'P54'), ('Jean Vincent', 'Reims', 'team', 'P54'), ('Jean Vincent', 'Reims', 'team', 'P54'), ('Robert Jonquet', 'Reims', 'team', 'P54'), ('Robert Jonquet', 'Reims', 'team', 'P54'), ('Robert Jonquet', 'Reims', 'team', 'P54'), ('Robert Jonquet', 'Reims', 'team', 'P54'), ('Armand Penverne', 'Reims', 'team', 'P54'), ('Armand Penverne', 'Reims', 'team', 'P54'), ('Armand Penverne', 'Reims', 'team', 'P54'), ('Armand Penverne', 'Reims', 'team', 'P54'), ('Roger Piantoni', 'Reims', 'team', 'P54'), ('Roger Piantoni', 'Reims', 'team', 'P54'), ('Roger Piantoni', 'Reims', 'team', 'P54'), ('Roger Piantoni', 'Reims', 'team', 'P54')]","['Stade de Reims ([stɑd də ʁɛ̃s]; commonly referred to as Stade Reims or simply Reims) is a French association football club based in Reims.', 'The club was formed in 1910 under the name Société Sportive du Parc Pommery and currently play in Ligue 1, the top level of French football having achieved promotion to the league following the 2011–12 season.', 'Reims plays its home matches at the Stade Auguste Delaune, a renovation of the old complex located within the city.', 'The team is managed by Olivier Guégan and captained by defender Mickaël Tacalfred.', 'Stade Reims is one of the most successful clubs in French football history having won six Ligue 1 titles, two Coupe de France trophies, and five Trophée des champions titles.', 'The club has also performed well on European level having finished as runners-up in the 1956 and 1959 editions of the European Cup and winning the Latin Cup and Coppa delle Alpi in 1953 and 1977, respectively.', 'However, since the 1980s, Reims have struggled to get back to their zenith.', 'The club hovered between Ligue 2 and the Championnat National for over thirty years after their relegation from the top flight in the 1978–79 season.', 'In 2012, though, they were promoted back to Ligue 1 where they currently remain.', 'Historically, Stade Reims is viewed as a legendary club within French football circles, not only due to its domestic and European accolades, but its charity towards the France national team through the 1940s and 50s, as well.', ""Reims were largely responsible for the first Golden Generation of French football with notable national team members Roger Marche, Raymond Kopa, Just Fontaine, Jean Vincent, Robert Jonquet, Armand Penverne, Dominique Colonna, and Roger Piantoni all playing for Reims during the national team's successful run to the semi-finals at the 1958 FIFA World Cup.""]",11,355,53
"Meritaten Tasherit, which means Meritaten the Younger was an ancient Egyptian princess of the 18th dynasty.

"The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (Russian SFSR or RSFSR; Russian: Российская Советская Федеративная Социалистическая Республика, Rossiyskaya Sovetskaya Federativnaya Sotsialisticheskaya Respublika About this sound listen ) commonly referred to as Soviet Russia or simply as Russia, was a sovereign state in 1917–22, the largest, most populous, and most economically developed republic of the Soviet Union in 1922–91 and a sovereign part of the Soviet Union with its own legislation in 1990–91. The Republic comprised sixteen autonomous republics, five autonomous oblasts, ten autonomous okrugs, six krais, and forty oblasts. Russians formed the largest ethnic group. To the west it bordered Finland, Norway and Poland; and to the south, China, Mongolia and North Korea whilst bordering the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Pacific Ocean to the east and the Black sea and Caspian Sea to the south. Within the USSR, it bordered the Baltic republics (Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia), the Byelorussian SSR and the Ukrainian SSR to the west. To the south it bordered the Georgian, Azerbaijan and Kazakh SSRs. The RSFSR was established on November 7, 1917 (October Revolution) as a sovereign state. The first Constitution was adopted in 1918. In 1922 the Russian SFSR signed the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR. The economy of Russia became heavily industrialized, accounting for about two-thirds of the electricity produced in the USSR. It was, by 1961, the third largest producer of petroleum due to new discoveries in the Volga-Urals region and Siberia, trailing only the United States and Saudi Arabia. In 1974, there were 475 institutes of higher education in the republic providing education in 47 languages to some 23,941,000 students. A network of territorially-organized public-health services provided health care. After 1985, the restructuring policies of the Gorbachev administration relatively liberalised the economy, which had become stagnant since the late 1970s, with the introduction of non-state owned enterprises such as cooperatives. The effects of market policies led to the failure of many enterprises and total instability by 1990. On June 12, 1990, the Congress of People's Deputies adopted the Declaration of State Sovereignty. On June 12, 1991, Boris Yeltsin was elected the first President. On December 8, 1991, heads of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus signed the Belavezha Accords. The agreement declared dissolution of the USSR by its founder states (i.e. denunciation of 1922 Treaty on the Creation of the USSR) and established the CIS. On December 12, the agreement was ratified by the Russian Parliament, therefore Russian SFSR denounced the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR and de facto declared Russia's independence from the USSR. On December 25, 1991, the Russian SFSR was renamed the Russian Federation. On December 26, 1991, the USSR was self-dissolved by the Soviet of Nationalities, which by that time was the only functioning house of the Supreme Soviet (the other house, Soviet of the Union, had already lost the quorum after recall of its members by the union republics). After dissolution of the USSR, Russia declared that it assumed the rights and obligations of the dissolved central Soviet government, including UN membership. The new Russian constitution, adopted on December 12, 1993 after a constitutional crisis, abolished the Soviet system of government in its entirety.","[('Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic', 'Soviet Union', 'part of', 'P361'), ('Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic', 'Soviet Union', 'sovereign state', 'P17'), ('Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic', 'Soviet Union', 'state', 'P17'), ('Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic', 'Soviet Union', 'part of', 'P361'), ('Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic', 'Soviet Union', 'sovereign state', 'P17'), ('Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic', 'Soviet Union', 'state', 'P17'), ('Russian SFSR', 'Soviet Union', 'part of', 'P361'), ('Russian SFSR', 'Soviet Union', 'sovereign state', 'P17'), ('Russian SFSR', 'Soviet Union', 'state', 'P17'), ('Russian SFSR', 'Soviet Union', 'part of', 'P361'), ('Russian SFSR', 'Soviet Union', 'sovereign state', 'P17'), ('Russian SFSR', 'Soviet Union', 'state', 'P17'), ('RSFSR', 'Soviet Union', 'part of', 'P361'), ('RSFSR', 'Soviet Union', 'sovereign state', 'P17'), ('RSFSR', 'Soviet Union', 'state', 'P17'), ('RSFSR', 'Soviet Union', 'part of', 'P361'), ('RSFSR', 'Soviet Union', 'sovereign state', 'P17'), ('RSFSR', 'Soviet Union', 'state', 'P17'), ('Russian', 'Soviet Union', 'part of', 'P361'), ('Russian', 'Soviet Union', 'sovereign state', 'P17'), ('Russian', 'Soviet Union', 'state', 'P17'), ('Russian', 'Soviet Union', 'part of', 'P361'), ('Russian', 'Soviet Union', 'sovereign state', 'P17'), ('Russian', 'Soviet Union', 'state', 'P17'), ('Soviet Russia', 'Soviet Union', 'part of', 'P361'), ('Soviet Russia', 'Soviet Union', 'sovereign state', 'P17'), ('Soviet Russia', 'Soviet Union', 'state', 'P17'), ('Soviet Russia', 'Soviet Union', 'part of', 'P361'), ('Soviet Russia', 'Soviet Union', 'sovereign state', 'P17'), ('Soviet Russia', 'Soviet Union', 'state', 'P17'), ('Russia', 'Soviet Union', 'part of', 'P361'), ('Russia', 'Soviet Union', 'sovereign state', 'P17'), ('Russia', 'Soviet Union', 'state', 'P17'), ('Russia', 'Soviet Union', 'part of', 'P361'), ('Russia', 'Soviet Union', 'sovereign state', 'P17'), ('Russia', 'Soviet Union', 'state', 'P17'), ('republic', 'Soviet Union', 'sovereign state', 'P17'), ('republic', 'Soviet Union', 'state', 'P17'), ('republic', 'Soviet Union', 'sovereign state', 'P17'), ('republic', 'Soviet Union', 'state', 'P17'), ('RSFSR', 'November 7, 1917', 'established', 'P571')]","['The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (Russian SFSR or RSFSR;

"The CIA has been involved in the Democratic Republic of the Congo sporadically for several decades, most notably in relation to the CIA's considerations and plans to assassinate former Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba and accusations of CIA involvement in his eventual assassination.

"Lou Cameron (June 20, 1924 – November 25, 2010) was an American writer and a comic book artist. He was born in San Francisco in 1924 to Lou Cameron Sr. and Ruth Marvin Cameron, a vaudeville comedian and his vocalist wife.Cameron served in Europe during World War II in the U.S. Army's 2nd Armored Division (""Hell On Wheels"").Before becoming a writer, Cameron illustrated comics such as Classics Illustrated and miscellaneous horror comics. One of his first written stories, ""The Last G.I.,"" is a science fiction story about American soldiers struggling to survive in a nuclear battlefield. It appeared in Real War (volume 2 number 2, October 1958). His work usually boasted muscular, no-nonsense prose through a prism of wry cynicism, sharp observation, and a signature combination of gusto with pulp-style gritty realism; he was also expert at devising unexpected, 11th hour plot twists. Fantastically versatile and prolific, his work ran the gamut in quality from inspired to for-the-buck cheap sensationalism. But his style remained individual and unmistakable. The film to book adaptations he wrote include None but the Brave (based on the anti-war film directed by and starring Frank Sinatra), California Split (based on the Joseph Walsh screenplay for the Robert Altman film starring Elliott Gould and George Segal), Sky Riders (based on the adventure film starring James Coburn, Robert Culp and Susannah York), Hannibal Brooks (based on the film written by the team of Dick Clement & Ian La Frenais for the Michael Winner film starring Oliver Reed and Michael J. Pollard), and an epic volume based on a number of scripts for the award winning CBS miniseries How the West Was Won that starred James Arness (not to be confused with the novelization by Louis L'Amour of the identically titled feature film, although the TV series was loosely based on that film). He also wrote two novels based on TV series: an original, The Outsider, based on the Private Eye series created by Roy Huggins and starring Darren McGavin; and ""A Praying Mantis Kills"", one of the novelizations of the Kung Fu television series, under the ""house name"" (shared pseudonym provided by the publisher) ""Howard Lee"". (The three other books in that series were written, also as Howard Lee, by Barry N. Maltzberg and Ron Goulart.) Alone among Cameron's tie-ins, ""The Outsider"" is written in the first person, from the POV of its main character, P.I. David Ross. Though that perspective is naturally derived from the main character's voice-over commentary in the episodes, Cameron often employed first person narrative in his original novels, particularly the earlier (1960-1970) standalone works, such as ""The Empty Quarter"", ""Angel's Flight"", ""The Good Guy"" and ""The Amphorae Pirates"".Cameron also created the character Longarm under the housename ""Tabor Evans"" and wrote at least 52 of the more-than-400 books in the series. He wrote the Renegade series as ""Ramsay Thorne"", and the Stringer series under his own name.

"Malamir (Bulgarian: Маламир) was the ruler of Bulgaria 831–836. Malamir was a son of Omurtag and a grandson of Krum. His name may be of Slavic origin, and is claimed to be the first Bulgar khan to possess a Slavic name; however another theory is that it was an Iranian name, as there is an Iranian city named Malamir. This has led to the speculation that his mother was a Slav, which cannot be proven. Malamir became ruler of Bulgaria in 831 on the death of his father Omurtag, because his older brother Enravota (Voin) had forfeited his right to the succession by becoming a Christian. It is possible that Malamir was young and inexperienced at the time of his accession, and that affairs of state were managed by his kavhan (kaukhanos) Isbul. About 833 Malamir executed his older brother Enravota for refusing to renounce Christianity. After the expiration of the original 20-year peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire in 836, emperor Theophilos ravaged the regions inside the Bulgarian frontier. The Bulgarians retaliated, and under the leadership of Isbul they reached Adrianople. At this time, if not earlier, the Bulgarians annexed Philippopolis (Plovdiv) and its environs. Several surviving monumental inscriptions from this reign make reference to the Bulgarian victories and others to the continuation of construction activities in and near Pliska. Malamir died in 836, allegedly as retribution for his execution of his older brother. In several older studies Malamir is identified with his successor Presian I, and it is assumed that he survived until the 850s as the direct predecessor of Boris I. This is very unlikely, as Malamir is attested as having been succeeded by his nephew (the son of his brother Zvinica), while Boris I was preceded by his father Presian I. Zlatarski resolved the problems in the fragmentary sources by determining that Malamir's unnamed nephew and successor was in fact Presian I, and Boris I was the latter's son. The 17th century Volga Bulgar compilation Ja'far Tarikh (a work of disputed authenticity) represents Balamir (i.e., Malamir) as the son of Yomyrčak (i.e., Omurtag), and as the brother of Sabanša (i.e., Zvinica), who was the father of Birdžihan (i.e., Presian I).

"The Rhine-Main S-Bahn system is an integrated rapid transit and commuter train system for the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main region, which includes the cities Frankfurt am Main, Wiesbaden, Mainz, Offenbach am Main, Hanau and Darmstadt. The network comprises nine S-Bahn lines, eight of which currently travel through the cornerstone of the system, an underground tunnel (the ""Citytunnel"") through central Frankfurt. The first section of this tunnel was opened on May 28, 1978. Further tunnel sections were opened in 1983 and 1990, before its completion in 1992. The system belongs to the Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund (RMV) and is operated by DB Regio AG, a subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn AG. End-to-end journey times on the nine lines in the system range from 36 minutes (on line S7) up to 87 minutes (on line S1). The longest journey time into central Frankfurt (Hauptwache), from any point on the network, is 54 minutes. Services on some lines start shortly after 4 a.m, while all lines have services from about 5 a.m. onwards. A full service is maintained from 6 a.m. until about 8 p.m., and a somewhat reduced service is run until the late evening. The last services leave Frankfurt at about 1:20 a.m. The S-Bahn system is quite closely integrated with other components of the region's transport system, such as the bus services in the various cities and towns, the tram services in Mainz, Frankfurt and Darmstadt, and the Frankfurt U-Bahn system. In Frankfurt, connections can be made, at either Hauptwache or its neighbouring station Konstablerwache, between the eight cross-city S-Bahn lines and eight of the city's nine U-Bahn lines, while the S-Bahn stations Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof and Frankfurt Süd between them have connection to six of the U-Bahn lines and any of the city's tram lines.

New York City makes up over 40% of the population of New York State. Two-thirds of the state's population lives in the New York City Metropolitan Area, and nearly 40% live on Long Island. Both the state and New York City were named for the 17th century Duke of York, future King James II of England. The next four most populous cities in the state are Buffalo, Rochester, Yonkers, and Syracuse, while the state capital is Albany. The earliest Europeans in New York were French colonists and Jesuit missionaries who arrived southward from settlements at Montreal for trade and proselytizing. New York had been inhabited by tribes of Algonquian and Iroquoian-speaking Native Americans for several hundred years by the time Dutch settlers moved into the region in the early 17th century. In 1609, the region was first claimed by Henry Hudson for the Dutch, who built Fort Nassau in 1614 at the confluence of the Hudson and Mohawk rivers, where the present-day capital of Albany later developed. The Dutch soon also settled New Amsterdam and parts of the Hudson Valley, establishing the colony of New Netherland, a multicultural community from its earliest days and a center of trade and immigration. The British annexed the colony from the Dutch in 1664. The borders of the British colony, the Province of New York, were similar to those of the present-day state. Many landmarks in New York are well known to both international and domestic visitors, with New York State hosting four of the world's ten most-visited tourist attractions in 2013: Times Square, Central Park, Niagara Falls (shared with Ontario), and Grand Central Terminal. New York is home to the Statue of Liberty, a symbol of the United States and its ideals of freedom, democracy, and opportunity. New York's higher education network comprises approximately 200 colleges and universities, including Columbia University, Cornell University, New York University, and Rockefeller University, which have been ranked among the top 35 in the world.","[('New York', 'New Jersey', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('New York', 'Connecticut', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('New York', 'Massachusetts', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('New York', 'Vermont', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('New Jersey', 'New York', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Connecticut', 'New York', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Connecticut', 'Massachusetts', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Massachusetts', 'New York', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Massachusetts', 'Connecticut', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Massachusetts', 'Vermont', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Vermont', 'New York', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Vermont', 'Massachusetts', 'bordered by', 'P47'), ('Quebec', 'Canadian', 'state', 'P17'), ('Quebec', 'Ontario', 'border', 'P47'), ('Quebec', 'Ontario', 'border', 'P47'), ('Ontario', 'Canadian', 'state', 'P17'), ('Ontario', 'Quebec', 'border', 'P47'), ('Ontario', 'Quebec', 'border', 'P47'), ('New York City', 'New York', 'city', 'P131'), ('New York City', 'New York State', 'city', 'P131'), ('United Nations Headquarters', 'New York City', 'city', 'P131'), ('New York City', 'King James II', 'named for', 'P138')]","['New York is a state in the Northeastern United States and is the 27th-most extensive, fourth-most populous, and seventh-most densely populated U.S. state.', 'New York is bordered by New Jersey and Pennsylvania to the south and Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Vermont to the east.', 'The state has a maritime border in the Atlantic Ocean with Rhode Island, east of Long Island, as well as an international border with the Canadian provinces of Quebec to the north and Ontario to the west and north.', ""The state of New York, with an estimated 19.8 million residents in 2015, is often referred to as New York State to distinguish it from New York City, the state's most populous city and its economic hub."", 'With an estimated population of nearly 8.5 million in 2014, New York City is the most populous city in the United States and the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States.', 'The New York City Metropolitan Area is one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world.', 'New York City is a global city, exerting a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term New York minute.', ""The home of the United Nations Headquarters, New York City is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world, as well as the world's most economically powerful city."", 'New York City makes up over 40% of the population of New York State.', ""Two-thirds of the state's population lives in the New York City Metropolitan Area, and nearly 40% live on Long Island."", 'Both the state and New York City were named for the 17th century Duke of York, future King James II of England.', 'The next four most populous cities in the state are Buffalo, Rochester, Yonkers, and Syracuse, while the state capital is Albany.', 'The earliest Europeans in New York were French colonists and Jesuit missionaries who arrived southward from settlements at Montreal for trade and proselytizing.', 'New York had been inhabited by tribes of Algonquian and Iroquoian-speaking Native Americans for several hundred years by the time Dutch settlers moved into the region in the early 17th century.', 'In 1609, the region was first claimed by Henry Hudson for the Dutch, who built Fort Nassau in 1614 at the confluence of the Hudson and Mohawk rivers, where the present-day capital of Albany later developed.', 'The Dutch soon also settled New Amsterdam and parts of the Hudson Valley, establishing the colony of New Netherland, a multicultural community from its earliest days and a center of trade and immigration.', 'The British annexed the colony from the Dutch in 1664.', 'The borders of the British colony, the Province of New York, were similar to those of the present-day state.', ""Many landmarks in New York are well known to both international and domestic visitors, with New York State hosting four of the world's ten most-visited tourist attractions in 2013: Times Square, Central Park, Niagara Falls (shared with Ontario), and Grand Central Terminal."", 'New York is home to the Statue of Liberty, a symbol of the United States and its ideals of freedom, democracy, and opportunity.', ""New York's higher education network comprises approximately 200 colleges and universities, including Columbia University, Cornell University, New York University, and Rockefeller University, which have been ranked among the top 35 in the world.""]",21,273,42

"Green Line or (pre-)1967 borders or 1949 Armistice borders refers to the demarcation lines set out in the 1949 Armistice Agreements between the armies of Israel and those of its neighbors (Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria) after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. The name derives from the green ink used to draw the line on the map while the armistice talks were going on. From Israel's perspective, the territories ""beyond"" the Green Line came to be designated as East Jerusalem, the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Golan Heights and Sinai Peninsula (the Sinai Peninsula has since been returned to Egypt as part of the 1979 peace treaty). The Green Line became especially significant in Israel after Israel captured these territories in the Six-Day War in 1967, when Israeli maps contained the Green Line. These territories have since 1967 often been referred to as Israeli occupied territories. The Green Line was intended as a demarcation line rather than a permanent border. The 1949 Armistice Agreements were clear (at Arab insistence) that they were not creating permanent borders. The Egyptian–Israeli agreement, for example, stated that ""the Armistice Demarcation Line is not to be construed in any sense as a political or territorial boundary, and is delineated without prejudice to rights, claims and positions of either Party to the Armistice as regards ultimate settlement of the Palestine question.""

"Emperor Ruizong of Tang (22 June 662 – 13 July 716), personal name Lǐ Dàn (李旦), known at times during his life as Li Xulun (李旭輪), Li Lun (李輪), Wu Lun (武輪), and Wu Dan (武旦), was the fifth and ninth emperor of Tang Dynasty. He was the eighth son of Emperor Gaozong and the fourth son of Emperor Gaozong's second wife Empress Wu (later known as Wu Zetian). In February 684, Li Dan's mother Empress Wu demoted his older brother Emperor Zhongzong (Li Xian) who had attempted to rule free of his mother, and named him emperor (as Emperor Ruizong). Emperor Ruizong, however, was a puppet under control of his mother and did not have any real power. In October 690 he ceded the imperial throne to his mother, who installed herself as ""emperor"" – the only woman in Chinese history ever to rule as emperor. Emperor Ruizong was reduced to the position of crown prince, with the unconventional title of Huangsi (皇嗣, literally ""imperial heir""). In the following years, Empress Wu's nephews Wu Chengsi and Wu Sansi tried to have one of them named heir to the throne, but Wu Zetian resisted these calls. Eventually, in October 698, faced with foreign invasion and dissatisfaction at home, Empress Wu accepted the suggestion of the chancellor Di Renjie and recalled the exiled Li Xian to the capital Luoyang. Soon, Li Dan offered to yield the position of crown prince to his elder brother, and Li Xian became crown prince instead. In 705, a coup overthrew Wu Zetian and restored Emperor Zhongzong to the throne. The five years of Emperor Zhongzong's reign were dominated by Zhongzong's empress consort, Empress Wei. In the beginning of July 710, Emperor Zhongzong died, allegedly poisoned by Empress Wei who then named Zhongzong's youngest son Li Chongmao the Prince of Wen emperor (as Emperor Shang). A mere two weeks later, Li Dan's sister Princess Taiping and Li Dan's son Li Longji the Prince of Linzi launched a coup which resulted in the death of Empress Wei. Princess Taiping, Li Longji, and Li Longji's brother Li Chengqi the Prince of Song then persuaded Li Dan to take the throne himself, and he agreed, returning the throne in Emperor Shang's stead. Li Longji, although not the oldest son, was made crown prince on account of his accomplishments. Soon, however, tensions between Princess Taiping, who had many supporters, and Li Longji mounted. Eventually, in September 712, Emperor Ruizong, believing that astrological signs called for a change of emperors, abdicated in favor of Li Longji (as Emperor Xuanzong). However, at Princess Taiping's suggestion, Emperor Ruizong, now carrying the title of Taishang Huang (retired emperor), continued to wield actual power. However, in 713, suspecting Princess Taiping of planning a coup, Emperor Xuanzong acted first, killing her associates and forcing her to commit suicide. After the death of Princess Taiping, Emperor Ruizong himself yielded imperial powers to Emperor Xuanzong and left the governmental scene.

It is bordered by Eritrea to the north and northeast, Djibouti and Somalia to the east, Sudan and South Sudan to the west, and Kenya to the south. With over 100 million inhabitants, Ethiopia is the most populous landlocked country in the world, as well as the second-most populous nation on the African continent after Nigeria. It occupies a total area of 1,100,000 square kilometres (420,000 sq mi), and its capital and largest city is Addis Ababa. Some of the oldest evidence for anatomically modern humans has been found in Ethiopia, which is widely considered the region from which Homo sapiens first set out for the Middle East and points beyond. According to linguists, the first Afroasiatic-speaking populations settled in the Horn region during the ensuing Neolithic era. Tracing its roots to the 2nd millennium BC, Ethiopia was a monarchy for most of its history. During the first centuries AD the Kingdom of Aksum maintained a unified civilization in the region. followed by Abyssinia circa 1137. Ethiopia derived prestige with its uniquely successful military resistance during the late 19th-century Scramble for Africa, becoming the only African country to defeat a European colonial power and retain its sovereignty. Subsequently, many African nations adopted the colors of Ethiopia's flag following their independence. It was the first independent African member of the 20th-century League of Nations and the United Nations. In 1974, at the end of Haile Selassie's reign, power fell to a communist military junta known as the Derg, backed by the Soviet Union, until it was defeated by the EPRDF, which has ruled since about the time of the collapse of the USSR in 1991. Ethiopia is a multilingual nation with around 80 ethnolinguistic groups, the three largest of which are the Tigray, Oromo and Amhara. Most people in the country speak Afroasiatic languages of the Cushitic or Semitic branches. Additionally, Omotic languages are spoken by Omotic ethnic minority groups inhabiting the southern regions, and languages from the Nilo-Saharan phylum are also spoken by the nation's Nilotic ethnic minorities. Ethiopia is the origin of the coffee bean. It is a land of natural contrasts, with its vast fertile West, jungles, and numerous rivers, the world's hottest settlement of Dallol in its north, Africa's largest continuous mountain ranges and the largest cave in Africa at Sof Omar. Ethiopia has the most UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Africa. Ethiopia's ancient Ge'ez script, also known as Ethiopic, is one of the oldest alphabets still in use in the world. The Ethiopian calendar, which is seven years and around three months behind the Gregorian calendar, co-exists alongside the Oromo calendar. A slight majority of the population adheres to Christianity (mainly the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and Pentay), while around a third follows Islam (primarily the Sunni denomination). The country is the site of the Hijrah to Abyssinia and the oldest Muslim settlement in Africa at Negash. A substantial population of Ethiopian Jews, known as Beta Israel, resided in Ethiopia until the 1980s but most of them have since gradually emigrated to Israel. Ethiopia is one of the founding members of the UN, the Group of 24 (G-24), the Non-Aligned Movement, G-77 and the Organisation of African Unity, with Addis Ababa serving as the headquarters of the African Union, the Pan African Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the UNECA, African Aviation Training HQ, the African Standby Force and much of global NGOs focused on Africa. Despite being the main source of the Nile, the longest river on Earth, Ethiopia underwent a series of famines in the 1980s, exacerbated by civil wars and adverse geopolitics. The country has begun to recover recently and now has the largest economy (by GDP) in East Africa and Central Africa.

"Kenya (/ˈkɛnjə/; [ˈkɛɲa]), officially the Republic of Kenya, is a country in Africa and a founding member of the East African Community (EAC). Its capital and largest city is Nairobi. Kenya's territory lies on the equator and overlies the East African Rift covering a diverse and expansive terrain that extends roughly from Lake Victoria to Lake Turkana (formerly called Lake Rudolf) and further south-east to the Indian Ocean. It is bordered by Tanzania to the south, Uganda to the west, South Sudan to the north-west, Ethiopia to the north and Somalia to the north-east. Kenya covers 581,309 km2 (224,445 sq mi), and had a population of approximately 45 million people in July 2014. Kenya has a warm and humid tropical climate on its Indian Ocean coastline. The climate is cooler in the savannah grasslands around the capital city, Nairobi, and especially closer to Mount Kenya, which has snow permanently on its peaks. Further inland, in the Nyanza region, there is a hot and dry climate which becomes humid around Lake Victoria, the largest tropical fresh-water lake in the world. This gives way to temperate and forested hilly areas in the neighboring western region. The north-eastern regions along the border with Somalia and Ethiopia are arid and semi-arid areas with near-desert landscapes. Kenya is known for its safaris, diverse climate and geography, and expansive wildlife reserves and national parks such as the East and West Tsavo National Park, the Maasai Mara, Lake Nakuru National Park, and Aberdares National Park. Kenya has several world heritage sites such as Lamu and numerous beaches, including in Diani, Bamburi and Kilifi, where international yachting competitions are held every year. The African Great Lakes region, which Kenya is a part of, has been inhabited by humans since the Lower Paleolithic period. By the first millennium AD, the Bantu expansion had reached the area from West-Central Africa. The borders of the modern state consequently comprise the crossroads of the Niger-Congo, Nilo-Saharan and Afroasiatic areas of the continent, representing most major ethnolinguistic groups found in Africa. Bantu and Nilotic populations together constitute around 97% of the nation's residents. European and Arab presence in coastal Mombasa dates to the Early Modern period; European exploration of the interior began in the 19th century. The British Empire established the East Africa Protectorate in 1895, which starting in 1920 gave way to the Kenya Colony. Kenya obtained independence in December 1963. Following a referendum in August 2010 and adoption of a new constitution, Kenya is now divided into 47 semi-autonomous counties, governed by elected governors. The capital, Nairobi, is a regional commercial hub. The economy of Kenya is the largest by GDP in East and Central Africa. Agriculture is a major employer; the country traditionally exports tea and coffee and has more recently begun to export fresh flowers to Europe. The service industry is also a major economic driver. Additionally, Kenya is a member of the East African Community trading bloc. The Republic of Kenya is named after Mount Kenya. The origin of the name Kenya is not clear, but perhaps linked to the Kikuyu, Embu and Kamba words Kirinyaga, Kirenyaa and Kiinyaa which mean ""God's resting place"" in all three languages. If so, then the British may not so much have mispronounced it ('Keenya'), as misspelled it. Prehistoric volcanic eruptions of Mount Kenya (now extinct) may have resulted in its association with divinity and creation among the indigenous Bantu ethnic groups, who are the native inhabitants of the agricultural land surrounding Mount Kenya.[original research?] In the 19th century, the German explorer Johann Ludwig Krapf was staying with the Bantu Kamba people when he first spotted the mountain. On asking for the name of the mountain, he was told ""Kĩ-Nyaa"" or ""Kĩĩma- Kĩĩnyaa"" probably because the pattern of black rock and white snow on its peaks reminded them of the feathers of the cock ostrich.

"Turkmenistan (/tɜːrkˈmɛnᵻstæn/ or /tɜːrkmɛnᵻˈstɑːn/; Turkmen: Türkmenistan/Түркменистан, [tyɾkmeniˈθtan]) is a country in Central Asia, bordered by Kazakhstan to the northwest, Uzbekistan to the north and east, Afghanistan to the southeast, Iran to the south and southwest, and the Caspian Sea to the west. Turkmenistan has been at the crossroads of civilizations for centuries. In medieval times, Merv was one of the great cities of the Islamic world and an important stop on the Silk Road, a caravan route used for trade with China until the mid-15th century. Annexed by the Russian Empire in 1881, Turkmenistan later figured prominently in the anti-Bolshevik movement in Central Asia. In 1924, Turkmenistan became a constituent republic of the Soviet Union, Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic (Turkmen SSR); it became independent upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Turkmenistan possesses the world's fourth largest reserves of natural gas resources. Most of the country is covered by the Karakum (Black Sand) Desert. Since 1993, citizens have received government-provided electricity, water and natural gas free of charge. Turkmenistan was ruled by President for Life Saparmurat Niyazov until his death in 2006. Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow was elected president in 2007. According to Human Rights Watch, ""Turkmenistan remains one of the world’s most repressive countries. The country is virtually closed to independent scrutiny, media and religious freedoms are subject to draconian restrictions, and human rights defenders and other activists face the constant threat of government reprisal.""

"Ionizing (or ionising in British English) radiation is radiation that carries enough energy to free electrons from atoms or molecules, thereby ionizing them. Ionizing radiation is made up of energetic subatomic particles, ions or atoms moving at high speeds (usually greater than 1% of the speed of light), and electromagnetic waves on the high-energy end of the electromagnetic spectrum. Gamma rays, X-rays, and the higher ultraviolet part of the electromagnetic spectrum are ionizing, whereas the lower ultraviolet part of the electromagnetic spectrum, and also the lower part of the spectrum below UV, including visible light (including nearly all types of laser light), infrared, microwaves, and radio waves are all considered non-ionizing radiation. The boundary between ionizing and non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation that occurs in the ultraviolet is not sharply defined, since different molecules and atoms ionize at different energies. Conventional definition places the boundary at a photon energy between 10 eV and 33 eV in the ultraviolet (see definition boundary section below). Typical ionizing subatomic particles from radioactivity include alpha particles, beta particles and neutrons. Almost all products of radioactive decay are ionizing because the energy of radioactive decay is typically far higher than that required to ionize. Other subatomic ionizing particles which occur naturally are muons, mesons, positrons, neutrons and other particles that constitute the secondary cosmic rays that are produced after primary cosmic rays interact with Earth's atmosphere. Cosmic rays may also produce radioisotopes on Earth (for example, carbon-14), which in turn decay and produce ionizing radiation. Cosmic rays and the decay of radioactive isotopes are the primary sources of natural ionizing radiation on Earth referred to as background radiation. In space, natural thermal radiation emissions from matter at extremely high temperatures (e.g. plasma discharge or the corona of the Sun) may be ionizing. Ionizing radiation may be produced naturally by the acceleration of charged particles by natural electromagnetic fields (e.g. lightning), although this is rare on Earth. Natural supernova explosions in space produce a great deal of ionizing radiation near the explosion, which can be seen by its effects in the glowing nebulae associated with them. Ionizing radiation can also be generated artificially using X-ray tubes, particle accelerators, and any of the various methods that produce radioisotopes artificially. Ionizing radiation is invisible and not directly detectable by human senses, so radiation detection instruments such as Geiger counters are required. However, ionizing radiation may lead to secondary emission of visible light upon interaction with matter, such as in Cherenkov radiation and radioluminescence. Ionizing radiation is applied constructively in a wide variety of fields such as medicine, research, manufacturing, construction, and many other areas, but presents a health hazard if proper measures against undesired exposure aren't followed. Exposure to ionizing radiation causes damage to living tissue, and can result in mutation, radiation sickness, cancer, and death.","[('Gamma rays', 'electromagnetic spectrum', 'part of', 'P361'),

"A thelony was a medieval toll or fee. It might be just or unjust. A just thelony was a toll paid as compensation for what would now be considered a public service. An unjust thelony was a fee exacted contrary to custom or where no service is rendered to the person made to pay it. Examples of just thelonies, taken from Charlemagne’s 805 Capitulary of Aix-la-Chapelle, are: a fee or toll for using a market, or for passage over a bridge when that has long been exacted, or for docking a ship for more than several days at a river bank. The same Capitulary gives as examples of unjust thelonies, the following: a toll on a bridge when none was exacted in the past, a fee for docking at a river bank for only a few days, a toll for passage on a road or through a forest or field, a toll exacted from persons going under a bridge. Another of Charlemagne’s capitularies from 805, that of Diedenhofen, forbade any “new or unjust thelony [to be] exacted where ropes are stretched or where ships pass under bridges, or in other similar cases in which no aid is lent to the travellers.” In 809, Charlemagne ordered: “[I]n the open country where there is no bridge built, we command that no thelony be exacted in any way.” Theodoric, King of the Franks, in 1036 decreed the customs and laws of thelony of Arras, for the use of the Monastery of St. Vaast, which was to receive the revenues from these thelonies. The thelonies listed were market dues to be paid by merchants for the purchase or sale of cloth, fish, fruits, grain, cheese, salt, charcoal, cattle, pigs, meat, the use of market stalls, and many other items. A list of thelonies for ships and barges bringing goods to Billingsgate, in London, circa 1000, required the payment not only of money, but also — in the case of the men of the Emperor who came in ships — to give as thelony “on Christmas Day two grey garments, and one brown, ten pounds of pepper, gloves for five men, two leathern tuns of vinegar, and as much at Easter.”Henry I, King of England, in 1133 granted the citizens of London freedom from all thelony: “And let all men of London and all their goods both throughout England, and in harbors, be quit and free of thelony, passage, lastage, and all other customs.” Moreover, if any town or manor compelled thelony from a citizen of London, “let the citizens of London take in their city from that town or manor where thelony or custom was taken, as much as the man of London gave for thelony, and thus he will have been recompensed for the harm.” As stated in the Wikipedia article History of the Jews in Speyer, Bishop Rüdiger of Speyer in 1084 invited a large number of Jews to live in his town ""in my endeavor to turn the village of Speyer into a city.""

"A primate city is a major city that works as the financial, political, and population center of a country and is not rivaled in any of these aspects by any other city in that country. Normally, a primate city must be at least twice as populous as the second largest city in the country. The presence of a primate city in a country usually indicates an imbalance in development — usually a progressive core, and a lagging periphery, on which the primate city depends for labor and other resources. Not all countries have primate cities (United States, Germany, India, and the People's Republic of China, for example), but in those that do, the rest of the country depends on it for cultural, economic, political, and major transportation needs. Among the best known examples of primate cities are the alpha world cities of London and Paris. Other major primate cities include Athens, Baghdad, Bangkok, Budapest, Buenos Aires, Cairo, Dublin, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Lima, Mexico City, Seoul, Tehran, and Vienna. Bangkok has been called ""the most primate city on earth"", being forty times larger than Thailand's second city. Some examples of nations without a primate city would include India, with the six main cities of Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad ; Canada, whose capital city, Ottawa, is overshadowed by the larger global cities of Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver; Brazil, whose capital and political center, Brasilia, is dwarfed in size and culture by São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Belo Horizonte; Italy, whose political seat at Rome is balanced by its business, financial, and fashion ""capital"" of Milan; Australia, which has the two main cities of Sydney and Melbourne, while the political centre resides in the smaller city of Canberra; South Africa, with three official capitals in Pretoria, Cape Town, and Bloemfontein, each housing a different branch of government, and whose main commercial centre is yet another city, Johannesburg; and the United States, whose financial and cultural centers are widely dispersed throughout the country in cities such as New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago and whose political center is located in Washington, D.C. In Turkey, the historical, cultural, financial, business and transportation center Istanbul is more than twice as large as the second-largest city Ankara, but Ankara is the political capital. Additionally, Mumbai, São Paulo, Ho Chi Minh City, Sydney, and Berlin have close competitors as their countries' largest cities (Delhi, Rio de Janeiro, Hanoi, Melbourne, and Hamburg respectively). Germany is unique, in that the post-Cold-War political center of Berlin is somewhat weak. Several major government institutions are spread throughout the country, in cities like Bonn (the former capital) and Karlsruhe (seat of the federal constitutional court). Likewise, Frankfurt is its most important financial centre, but has significant competition from Düsseldorf and Munich. Germany's cultural center is split between Berlin, Munich, Cologne, Dresden, and smaller cities. However, Berlin was considered a primate city of Germany in the years 1871-1945. Whether primate cities or not, alpha cities tend to produce a large percentage of their countries' respective gross domestic product (GDP) and gross metropolitan product (GMP), though primate cities tend to have a larger economic influence individually over a country. The three largest world metros consisting of a combined statistical area (CSA), by GMP, are the Greater Tokyo, New York, and Los Angeles metropolitan areas. Each of these cities have a GMP approaching the $1 trillion mark. This is largely due to the vast amounts of trade, finance, manufacturing, fashion, media, science, research and technology, transportation (air, ocean/shipping, land), warehousing, and other industries that provide jobs and end products on mass scales with easy access to worldwide markets and other alpha and primate cities. In addition many multinational corporations are headquartered in many alpha and primate cities. Some countries, such as the United States, Australia and Canada, have regional and/or provincial/state primate cities, such as Atlanta, Georgia; Winnipeg, Manitoba; and Perth in Western Australia.","[('Bangkok', 'Thailand', 'city', 'P131'), ('Bangkok', 'Thailand', 'city', 'P131'), ('India', 'Delhi', 'capital city', 'P36'), ('India', 'Delhi', 'capital', 'P36'), ('India', 'Delhi', 'capital', 'P36'), ('India', 'Delhi', 'capital', 'P36'), ('Delhi', 'India', 'country', 'P17'), ('Mumbai', 'India', 'country', 'P17'), ('Kolkata', 'India', 'country', 'P17'), ('Chennai', 'India', 'country', 'P17'), ('Bangalore', 'India', 'country', 'P17'), ('Hyderabad', 'India', 'country', 'P17'), ('Canada', 'Ottawa', 'capital city', 'P36'), ('Canada', 'Ottawa', 'capital', 'P36'), ('Canada', 'Ottawa', 'capital', 'P36'), ('Canada', 'Ottawa', 'capital', 'P36'), ('Ottawa', 'Canada', 'country', 'P17'), ('Toronto', 'Canada', 'country', 'P17'), ('Montreal', 'Canada', 'country', 'P17'), ('Vancouver', 'Canada', 'country', 'P17'), ('São Paulo', 'Brazil', 'country', 'P17'), ('Rio de Janeiro', 'Brazil', 'country', 'P17'), ('Belo Horizonte', 'Brazil', 'country', 'P17'), ('Italy', 'Rome', 'capital city', 'P36'), ('Italy', 'Rome', 'capital', 'P36'), ('Italy', 'Rome', 'capital', 'P36'), ('Italy', 'Rome', 'capital', 'P36'), ('Rome', 'Italy', 'country', 'P17'), ('Milan', 'Italy', 'country', 'P17'), ('Australia', 'Canberra', 'capital city', 'P36'), ('Australia', 'Canberra', 'capital', 'P36'), ('Australia', 'Canberra', 'capital', 'P36'), ('Australia', 'Canberra', 'capital', 'P36'), ('Sydney', 'Australia', 'country', 'P17'), ('Melbourne', 'Australia', 'country', 'P17'), ('Canberra', 'Australia', 'country', 'P17'), ('South Africa', 'Pretoria', 'capital city', 'P36'), ('South Africa', 'Pretoria', 'capital', 'P36'), ('South Africa', 'Pretoria', 'capital', 'P36'), ('South Africa', 'Pretoria', 'capital', 'P36'), ('South Africa', 'Cape Town', 'capital city', 'P36'), ('South Africa', 'Cape Town', 'capital', 'P36'), ('South Africa', 'Cape Town', 'capital', 'P36'), ('South Africa', 'Cape Town', 'capital', 'P36'), ('South Africa', 'Bloemfontein', 'capital city', 'P36'), ('South Africa', 'Bloemfontein', 'capital', 'P36'), ('South Africa', 'Bloemfontein', 'capital', 'P36'), ('South Africa', 'Bloemfontein', 'capital', 'P36'), ('Pretoria', 'South Africa', 'country', 'P17'), ('Cape Town', 'South Africa', 'country', 'P17'), ('Bloemfontein', 'South Africa', 'country', 'P17'), ('Johannesburg', 'South Africa', 'country', 'P17'), ('New York City', 'United States', 'country', 'P17'), ('Los Angeles', 'United States', 'country', 'P17'), ('Chicago', 'United States', 'country', 'P17'), ('Washington, D.C.', 'United States', 'country', 'P17'), ('Turkey', 'Ankara', 'capital', 'P36'), ('Turkey', 'Ankara', 'capital', 'P36'), ('Atlanta, Georgia', 'United States', 'state', 'P17'), ('Winnipeg, Manitoba', 'Canada', 'state', 'P17'), ('Perth', 'Australia', 'state', 'P17'), ('Western Australia', 'Australia', 'state', 'P17')]","['A primate city is a major city that works as the financial, political, and population center of a country and is not rivaled in any of these aspects by any other city in that country.', 'Normally, a primate city must be at least twice as populous as the second largest city in the country.', 'The presence of a primate city in a country usually indicates an imbalance in development — usually a progressive core, and a lagging periphery, on which the primate city depends for labor and other resources.', ""Not all countries have primate cities (United States, Germany, India, and the People's Republic of China, for example), but in those that do, the rest of the country depends on it for cultural, economic, political, and major transportation needs."", 'Among the best known examples of primate cities are the alpha world cities of London and Paris.', 'Other major primate cities include Athens, Baghdad, Bangkok, Budapest, Buenos Aires, Cairo, Dublin, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Lima, Mexico City, Seoul, Tehran, and Vienna.', 'Bangkok has been called ""the most primate city on earth"", being forty times larger than Thailand\'s second city.', 'Some examples of nations without a primate city would include India, with the six main cities of Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad ;

"Queen Elizabeth II, present sovereign of the Commonwealth realms, is the daughter of King George VI, the second son of King George V and Queen Mary; and of Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon (later Queen Elizabeth, and, after her daughter's accession to the throne, the Queen Mother), the daughter of Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, and his wife, Cecilia Bowes-Lyon, Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne. Queen Elizabeth II is the male-line great-granddaughter of Edward VII, who inherited the crown from his mother, Queen Victoria. His father, Victoria's consort, was Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha; hence Queen Elizabeth is a patrilineal descendant of Albert's family, the German princely House of Wettin. (Other notable members of this house are King Philippe of Belgium and former King Simeon II of Bulgaria.) Traced as far as possible, Elizabeth's male-line ancestry stretches back to Theodoric I, Count of Wettin; see . Elizabeth is directly descended from many British royals: from the House of Stuart, from Mary, Queen of Scots; Robert the Bruce, and earlier Scottish royal houses; from the House of Tudor, and earlier Irish and English royal houses stretching back as far as the 7th century House of Wessex. As a great-great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria, she is related to the heads of most other reigning and non-reigning European royal houses. Through her great-grandmother Queen Alexandra, she is descended from the Danish royal House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, a line of the North German house of Oldenburg. (Other members of the House of Glücksburg include Elizabeth's husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, as well as Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, King Harald V of Norway, Queen Sofía of Spain and former King Constantine II of Greece—each of whom is also descended from Queen Victoria; one of her many cousins is King Juan Carlos I of Spain, also a great-great-grandson of Victoria.)

During the 1970s he entered the Afghan foreign service. He was sent to the United States to represent the political administration supported by the Soviet Union. As the Ambassador to the UN, Mr. Ghafoorzai thought it his duty to call on the global partners to denounce the Soviet invasion in 1979. From then until 1992, he worked as a representative official to trigger international support against the regime that the Soviets had set up in Afghanistan. When the communist government fell in 1992, Ghafoorzai acted as an intermediary to unite the factions of Afghanistan. He worked in the United Nations until 1995, and then became deputy foreign minister. He became foreign minister in July 1996. in September 1996 the government troops withdrew from Kabul and the Taliban captured Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, The International community did not recognize the Taliban as Afghanistan legitimate government except Pakistan, United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, the Islamic State of Afghanistan government established the new cabinet in Mazar e Sharif in the north of Afghanistan, meanwhile the Afghanistan Embassies and the Permanent Mission of Afghanistan to the United Nations was in control of Islamic State of Afghanistan as legitimate representative of Afghanistan.

"Olympiacos Piraeus B.C. (Greek: ΚΑΕ Ολυμπιακός Σ.Φ.Π.), also known simply as Olympiacos, or with its full name Olympiacos SFP Basketball S.A., is a Greek professional basketball club, part of the major multi-sport club Olympiacos CFP, based in Piraeus. The basketball club, founded in 1931, is one of the most successful clubs in European basketball, having won three Euroleague Championships, one Triple Crown, one Intercontinental Cup, eleven Greek Championships and nine Greek Cups. They are a traditional powerhouse of the Euroleague and besides their three European Championship titles, they have also been four times Euroleague runners-up (1994, 1995, 2010, 2015) and have participated, altogether, in nine Euroleague Final Fours (1994, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015). From 2006 to 2015, Olympiacos qualified 10 times in a row for at least the quarter-finals of the Euroleague, which is an all-time record in European basketball history (shared with FC Barcelona). They play their home matches at Peace and Friendship Stadium. The first major achievement of Olympiacos in European competitions was their presence in the European Champions Cup semifinal group stage in 1979, but it was in the 1990s that Olympiacos made their biggest mark. They reached the Euroleague Final in two consecutive seasons, 1994 and 1995, being the first Greek club that ever played in a Euroleague Final, and they won their first Euroleague title in 1997 after a convincing 73–58 win against FC Barcelona in the final, thus achieving the first Triple Crown ever for a Greek team. As European champions, Olympiacos played in the 1997 McDonald's Championship and reached the final of the tournament, where they met Michael Jordan's NBA champions, the Chicago Bulls. They also dominated Greek basketball during the decade of the 90s, when Greek Basket League was considered Europe's best professional league. Based on all those achievements, FIBA declared Olympiacos as the Best European Team of the 1990s. Olympiacos returned to the very top of European basketball in 2010 when they reached the final against FC Barcelona in Paris, but mostly in 2012, when they won their second Euroleague title in Istanbul by rallying from 19 points down in the championship game to beat CSKA Moscow 62–61 on the last shot of the game, achieving the greatest comeback in European basketball finals history, and one of the greatest ever seen in continental basketball. In 2013, Olympiacos won their third Euroleague title and became the first and only Greek club, and only the third club in European basketball history, to become back-to-back European champions in the modern Final Four era of the Euroleague, after beating Real Madrid 100–88 in the final of the 2012–13 Euroleague Final Four in London. Some of the greatest players in European basketball have played for Olympiacos over the years including: Charlie Yelverton, Carey Scurry, Žarko Paspalj, Dragan Tarlać, Walter Berry, Panagiotis Fasoulas, Roy Tarpley, Eddie Johnson, Alexander Volkov, David Rivers, Christian Welp, Artūras Karnišovas, Arijan Komazec, Dino Rađa, Theodoros Papaloukas, Alphonso Ford, Tyus Edney, Arvydas Macijauskas, Miloš Teodosić, Nikola Vujčić, Josh Childress, Linas Kleiza, Rašo Nesterović, Vassilis Spanoulis, Giorgos Printezis, Kostas Papanikolaou, Stratos Perperoglou, Kyle Hines and Acie Law. Under the ownership of billionaire Greek brothers Panagiotis Angelopoulos and Giorgos Angelopoulos, Olympiacos made a record transfer in 2008, by signing NBA player Josh Childress, whose US$20 million

"Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior ([nejˈmaʁ dɐ ˈsiwvɐ ˈsɐ̃tus ˈʒũɲoʁ]; born 5 February 1992), commonly known as Neymar or Neymar Jr., is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays for Spanish club FC Barcelona and the Brazil national team as a forward or winger, and is also the captain of the national team. At the age of 19, Neymar won the 2011 South American Footballer of the Year award, after coming third in 2010. He followed this up by winning it again in 2012. In 2011 Neymar won the FIFA Puskás Award for Goal of the Year. In 2015 he came third for the FIFA Ballon d'Or behind Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. Neymar is known for his acceleration, dribbling skills, finishing and ability with both feet. His playing style has earned him critical acclaim, with fans, media and former players drawing comparison to former Brazil forward Pelé, who has called Neymar ""an excellent player"", while Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and Lionel Messi have stated ""he will be the best in the world"". Neymar joined Santos in 2003 and, aged 17, made his debut for the club in 2009 and was voted the Best Young Player of the 2009 Campeonato Paulista. Neymar was named player of the year as Santos won the 2010 Campeonato Paulista, and he was also top scorer in the 2010 Copa do Brasil with 11 goals. He finished the 2010 season with 42 goals in 60 games, as his club achieved the Double. Neymar was again voted the player of the year in 2011 as Santos retained the state title and also won the 2011 Copa Libertadores securing a Continental Double, Santos' first since 1963. Joining Barcelona in June 2013, in his second season at the club in 2014–15, Neymar helped them win the continental treble of La Liga, Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League. Neymar has represented Brazil at Under-17, Under-20 and senior levels. On 10 August 2010, aged 18, he made his senior debut for Brazil in a friendly match against the United States; he scored in a 2–0 win. Neymar was the leading goal scorer of the 2011 South American Youth Championship with nine goals, including two in the final, in the 6–0 win against Uruguay. He was named in Brazil's squad for the 2013 Confederations Cup, and was assigned the number 10 shirt. On 30 June, Neymar scored Brazil's second goal in the 3–0 final win over Spain. His performances saw him receive the golden ball as player of the tournament. At the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Neymar scored four goals before he suffered a fractured vertebra in his spine in the quarter-finals and missed the rest of the tournament. He received the Bronze Boot as the tournament's third top goalscorer, and was named in the World Cup All Star XI. Neymar captained Brazil at the 2015 Copa América, but in the group stage was given a suspension which ruled him out for the rest of the tournament. With 46 goals in 67 matches for Brazil, Neymar is the fifth highest goalscorer for his national team. In 2012 and 2013, SportsPro named him the most marketable athlete in the world. In December 2015 he was ranked by The Guardian as the third best player in the world.","[('Neymar', 'Santos', 'team', 'P54'), ('Neymar', 'Santos', 'team', 'P54'), ('Neymar', 'Santos', 'plays for', 'P54'), ('Neymar', 'FC Barcelona', 'team', 'P54'), ('Neymar', 'FC Barcelona', 'team', 'P54'), ('Neymar', 'FC Barcelona', 'plays for', 'P54'), ('Neymar', 'Brazil national team', 'team', 'P54'), ('Neymar', 'Brazil national team', 'team', 'P54'), ('Neymar', 'Brazil national team', 'plays for', 'P54'), ('Neymar', 'Santos', 'team', 'P54'), ('Neymar', 'Santos', 'team', 'P54'), ('Neymar', 'Santos', 'plays for', 'P54'), ('Neymar', 'FC Barcelona', 'team', 'P54'), ('Neymar', 'FC Barcelona', 'team', 'P54'), ('Neymar', 'FC Barcelona', 'plays for', 'P54'), ('Neymar', 'Brazil national team', 'team', 'P54'), ('Neymar', 'Brazil national team', 'team', 'P54'), ('Neymar', 'Brazil national team', 'plays for', 'P54'), ('Neymar Jr', 'Santos', 'team', 'P54'), ('Neymar Jr', 'Santos', 'team', 'P54'), ('Neymar Jr', 'Santos', 'plays for', 'P54'), ('Neymar Jr', 'FC Barcelona', 'team', 'P54'), ('Neymar Jr', 'FC Barcelona', 'team', 'P54'), ('Neymar Jr', 'FC Barcelona', 'plays for', 'P54'), ('Neymar Jr', 'Brazil national team', 'team', 'P54'), ('Neymar Jr', 'Brazil national team', 'team', 'P54'), ('Neymar Jr', 'Brazil national team', 'plays for', 'P54'), ('Neymar', 'Brazil', 'team', 'P54')]","['Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior ([nejˈmaʁ dɐ ˈsiwvɐ ˈsɐ̃tus ˈʒũɲoʁ]; born 5 February 1992), commonly known as Neymar or Neymar Jr., is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays for Spanish club FC Barcelona and the Brazil national team as a forward or winger, and is also the captain of the national team.', 'At the age of 19, Neymar won the 2011 South American Footballer of the Year award, after coming third in 2010.', 'He followed this up by winning it again in 2012.', 'In 2011 Neymar won the FIFA Puskás Award for Goal of the Year.', ""In 2015 he came third for the FIFA Ballon d'Or behind Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo."", 'Neymar is known for his acceleration, dribbling skills, finishing and ability with both feet.', 'His playing style has earned him critical acclaim, with fans, media and former players drawing comparison to former Brazil forward Pelé, who has called Neymar ""an excellent player"", while Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and Lionel Messi have stated ""he will be the best in the world"".', 'Neymar joined Santos in 2003 and, aged 17, made his debut for the club in 2009 and was voted the Best Young Player of the 2009 Campeonato Paulista.', 'Neymar was named player of the year as Santos won the 2010 Campeonato Paulista, and he was also top scorer in the 2010 Copa do Brasil with 11 goals.', 'He finished the 2010 season with 42 goals in 60 games, as his club achieved the Double.', ""Neymar was again voted the player of the year in 2011 as Santos retained the state title and also won the 2011 Copa Libertadores securing a Continental Double, Santos' first since 1963."", 'Joining Barcelona in June 2013, in his second season at the club in 2014–15, Neymar helped them win the continental treble of La Liga, Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League.', 'Neymar has represented Brazil at Under-17, Under-20 and senior levels.', 'On 10 August 2010, aged 18, he made his senior debut for Brazil in a friendly match against the United States; he scored in a 2–0 win.', 'Neymar was the leading goal scorer of the 2011 South American Youth Championship with nine goals, including two in the final, in the 6–0 win against Uruguay.', ""He was named in Brazil's squad for the 2013 Confederations Cup, and was assigned the number 10 shirt."", ""On 30 June, Neymar scored Brazil's second goal in the 3–0 final win over Spain."", 'His performances saw him receive the golden ball as player of the tournament.', 'At the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Neymar scored four goals before he suffered a fractured vertebra in his spine in the quarter-finals and missed the rest of the tournament.', ""He received the Bronze Boot as the tournament's third top goalscorer, and was named in the World Cup All Star XI."", 'Neymar captained Brazil at the 2015 Copa América, but in the group stage was given a suspension which ruled him out for the rest of the tournament.', 'With 46 goals in 67 matches for Brazil, Neymar is the fifth highest goalscorer for his national team.', 'In 2012 and 2013, SportsPro named him the most marketable athlete in the world.', 'In December 2015 he was ranked by The Guardian as the third best player in the world.']",24,307,52

"A capital territory or capital district is normally a specially designated administrative division where a country's seat of government is located. As such, in a federal model of government, no state or territory has any political or economic advantage relative to the others because of the national capital lying within its borders. A capital territory can be a specific form of federal district. A distinction should be made from administrative divisions which include national capitals, but have no special designated status legally (for example, Île de France has no distinct quality from other regions of France). Some federal countries (like Belgium and Germany), give their national capitals the status as full, equal federal units. Some federal countries have made no distinction administratively for the territory around the capital. A few federal countries have their national capitals located in the capital city of a federal state: Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, is also the capital of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, one of federal units and de jure capital of Republika Srpska, the other federal unit; further, Bern, the capital of Switzerland, is the capital of the Canton of Bern. Two national capitals in federal countries are neither federal units, special capital districts, nor capitals of federal units: Ottawa, the capital of Canada, and Palikir, the capital of the Federated States of Micronesia. The Canadian government does designate the Ottawa area as the National Capital Region, although this term merely represents the jurisdictional area of the government agency that administers federally owned lands and buildings, and is not an actual administrative unit. The city of Ottawa is governed as a regular city. In some non-federal countries there are capital regions that don't have special significance, but have names hinting that. For example, the Capital Region of Denmark is a name of a normal national region.

"The North Borneo Federation, also known as North Kalimantan or Negara Kesatuan Kalimantan Utara in Malay, was a proposed political entity which would have comprised the British Colonies of Sarawak, British North Borneo (now known as the Malaysian state of Sabah) and the protectorate of Brunei. In 1956, the governments of Sarawak, North Borneo and the State of Brunei announced that they would abandon the Malayan dollar and adopt a common currency of their own, but that never came into being. The idea of the North Kalimantan was proposed by Brunei's People Party President, A. M. Azahari, who had forged links with Sukarno's nationalist movement, together with Ahmad Zaidi, in Java in the 1940s. The idea supported and propagated the unification of all Borneo territories under British rule to form an independent leftist North Kalimantan state. Azahari personally favoured Brunei's independence and merging with British North Borneo and Sarawak to form the federation with the Sultan of Brunei as the constitutional monarch. However, the Brunei People’s Party was in favour of joining Malaysia on the condition it was as the unified three territories of northern Borneo with their own Sultan, and hence was strong enough to resist domination by Malaya, Singapore, Malay administrators or Chinese merchants. The North Borneo (or Kalimantan Utara) proposal was seen as a post-decolonisation alternative by local opposition against the Malaysia plan. Local opposition throughout the Borneo territories was primarily based on economic, political, historical and cultural differences between the Borneo states and Malaya, as well as the refusal to be subjected under peninsular political domination. Joining to form Malaysia was seen as a new form of colonialism under Malaya. The basic concept behind the formation of a union of British Borneo was partly based upon the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in Southern Africa. After the defeat of the revolutionaries in the Brunei Revolt, the idea was put to rest. Had the federation been formed, the capital city would probably have been chosen from Kuching (capital of Sarawak), Jesselton (present-day Kota Kinabalu, capital of Sabah) or Bandar Brunei (present-day Bandar Seri Begawan, capital of Brunei and the historical capital of the region). The Sultanate of Brunei has traditionally opposed such a federation.

"The territorial dispute between Ecuador and Peru was the source of the longest-running international armed conflict in the Western Hemisphere.[citation needed] This dispute was a consequence of the imprecise geographical definitions used in colonial times to define the limits of the Royal Audiences; after Peru and neighboring Gran Colombia proclaimed independence from the Spanish crown in 1821 and 1819, respectively, this dispute led to the war of 1828. In the aftermath, the belligerent parties agree to proclaim their limits in the basis of the principle uti possidetis juris and the border became the one that existed between the Spanish viceroyalties of Peru and New Granada. When the Republic of Ecuador proclaimed its secession from Gran Colombia in 1830 its government negotiated a swap of territories in the Amazon basin for debt with the British creditors, and the dispute over the territories re-ignited in 1857. Peru implemented a maritime blockade of the port of Guayaquil demanding a revocation of the deal, as well as an acknowledgment of Peruvian sovereignty over the disputed territories. These demands went unheeded and with Ecuador in a state of civil war, the government of Guillermo Franco in the province of Guayaquil, claiming to represent the entire country, agreed to Peru's demands and signed the Treaty of Mapasingue of 1860. Gabriel García Moreno's provisional government won the civil war later that year, and voided this treaty, with the new Peruvian government following suit several years later. The dispute continued through the late 19th century and beginning of the 20th century. Numerous attempts were made to define the borders, but both governments could not come to an agreement acceptable to their constituencies. A war between Colombia and Peru occurred during 1932 and 1933 in the Eastern region of the Amazon territories and resulted in the official designation of the Putumayo River as a border between Colombia and Peru; but sectors of the society considered this detrimental to the Ecuadorian cause, with Colombia now recognizing Peru's rights to the territory that Ecuador claimed as its own. An agreement recognizing territories in de facto possession by each country was signed in 1936, but minor military skirmishes began to occur in 1938. Tensions escalated, and war broke out in July 1941, and officially came to an end with the signing of the Rio de Janeiro Protocol on January 29, 1942. The treaty was intended to finally bring the long-running territorial dispute to an end, but in 1960 the then president of Ecuador Dr. José Mª Velasco Ibarra proposed to the Congress a thesis of nullity based in the fact that the 1942 protocol was forced unto the Ecuadorian government under duress. A brief military clash took place in early 1981, when the Peruvian Army forcefully took control of three Ecuadorian military outposts on the eastern slopes of the Cordillera del Cóndor mountain range. An agreement in 1992 between the presidents of the two countries promised to seek peaceful resolution to the conflict. However, in December 1994, the Ecuadorian army was seen to be mobilizing in the vicinity of the Cordillera del Cóndor. On January 26, 1995, war broke out over control of several outposts located on the headwaters of the Cenepa River, within a 78-kilometer strip of territory that both countries claimed as their own. In this case, the result was favorable for Peru who succeeded in taking all the Ecuadorian outposts set in Peruvian territory, although Ecuador caused some casualties. The fighting came to an end after just over one month, with the signing of the Montevideo Declaration on February 28, and the later signing of the Itamaraty Peace Declaration under the supervision of the guarantors of the Rio Protocol of 1942: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and the U.S. Tensions subsided but persisted over the next three years. On October 26, 1998, Ecuador and Peru signed a comprehensive peace accord that established a framework for ending a border dispute. Formal demarcation of border regions started on May 13, 1999. The agreement was ratified without opposition by the congresses of both nations, finally bringing an end to the dispute, almost two centuries after the South American nations (or their predecessors) claimed their independence from the Spanish Crown.","[('Guayaquil', 'Ecuador', 'country', 'P17'), ('Guayaquil', 'Ecuador', 'state', 'P17'), ('Colombia', 'Peru', 'border', 'P47'), ('Colombia', 'Peru', 'border', 'P47'), ('Colombia', 'Peru', 'border', 'P47'), ('Colombia', 'Ecuador', 'border', 'P47'), ('Peru', 'Colombia', 'border', 'P47'), ('Peru', 'Colombia', 'border', 'P47'), ('Peru', 'Colombia', 'border', 'P47'), ('Peru', 'Ecuador', 'border', 'P47'), ('Colombia', 'Peru', 'border', 'P47'), ('Colombia', 'Peru', 'border', 'P47'), ('Colombia', 'Peru', 'border', 'P47'), ('Colombia', 'Ecuador', 'border', 'P47'), ('Peru', 'Colombia', 'border', 'P47'), ('Peru', 'Colombia', 'border', 'P47'), ('Peru', 'Colombia', 'border', 'P47'), ('Peru', 'Ecuador', 'border', 'P47'), ('Colombia', 'Peru', 'border', 'P47'), ('Colombia', 'Peru', 'border', 'P47'), ('Colombia', 'Peru', 'border', 'P47'), ('Colombia', 'Ecuador', 'border', 'P47'), ('Peru', 'Colombia', 'border', 'P47'), ('Peru', 'Colombia', 'border', 'P47'), ('Peru', 'Colombia', 'border', 'P47'), ('Peru', 'Ecuador', 'border', 'P47'), ('Ecuador', 'Colombia', 'border', 'P47'), ('Ecuador', 'Peru', 'border', 'P47'), ('Ecuador', 'Colombia', 'border', 'P47'), ('Ecuador', 'Peru', 'border', 'P47'), ('Ecuador', 'Colombia', 'border', 'P47'), ('Ecuador', 'Peru', 'border', 'P47'), ('Ecuador', 'Peru', 'border', 'P47'), ('Peru', 'Ecuador', 'border', 'P47')]","['The territorial dispute between Ecuador and Peru was the source of the longest-running international armed conflict in the Western Hemisphere.', '[citation needed] This dispute was a consequence of the imprecise geographical definitions used in colonial times to define the limits of the Royal Audiences;

"The National Basketball Association (NBA) is major professional basketball league in North America. The league was founded in 1946 as the Basketball Association of America (BAA). The league adopted its current name at the start of 1949–1950 season when it merged with the National Basketball League (NBL). The league currently consists of thirty teams, of which twenty-nine are located in the United States and one in Canada. Each team plays 82 games in the regular season. Eight teams from each of the league's two conferences qualify for the playoffs. The winners of the Conference Finals advance to the finals to determine the NBA champions. The Boston Celtics have had or tied for the best regular season record for a record 18 times. They won the Eastern Conference (known as the Eastern Division until 1970) for a record 21 times, while the Los Angeles Lakers won the Western Conference (known as the Western Division until 1970) for a record 31 times.

The best single regular season record was recorded by the Chicago Bulls in the 1995–1996 season. In that season, the Bulls recorded 72 wins and 10 losses with a winning percentage of .878. The Bulls then went on to win the Eastern Conference and the NBA championship. The Bulls are the only team to win at least 70 games in a single season. In that season, the Bulls achieved several awards and honors: Michael Jordan won the scoring title, the regular season Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award, the All-Star Game MVP Award and the Finals MVP Award; Dennis Rodman won the rebounding title; Toni Kukoč won the Sixth Man of the Year Award; Jordan and Scottie Pippen were named in the All-NBA First Team; Jordan, Pippen and Rodman were named in the All-Defensive First Team; and coach Phil Jackson won the Coach of the Year Award.

"Religion in Israel is a central feature of the country and plays a major role in shaping Israeli culture and lifestyle, and religion has played a central role in Israel's history.[citation needed] Israel is also the only country in the world where a majority of citizens are Jewish.

"In Greek mythology, Dorus (Ancient Greek: Δῶρος) is a son of Hellen who was the eponymous founder of the Dorians. Each of Hellen's sons founded a primary tribe of Greece: Aeolus the Aeolians, Dorus the Dorians and Xuthus the Achaeans (from Xuthus's son Achaeus) and Ionians (from Xuthus's adopted son Ion, in truth a son of the god Apollo), aside from his sister Pandora's sons with Zeus. According to the Bibliotheke, ""Dorus received the country over against Peloponnese and called the settlers Dorians after himself."" Dorus was killed by Apis when he tried to invade the Peloponnese. According to Karl Kerenyi, the Dorians recalled that three times Heracles had aided their ""oldest king"", Aigimios, ""under whom they had not yet emigrated to the Peleponnesos."" Kerenyi's source is the Bibliotheca (II.7.7), who though he is late, was working with ancient materials lost to us. The eponymous figure of ""Dorus"" is a back-formation: all tribal groups have myths of an ""original', whose name is the eponym of the tribe, even tribal eponyms in Genesis. The oldest are essentially eponyms of extended families, who were worshipped in archaic cults into Roman times. A man's name, Dōrieus, occurs in the Linear B tablets at Pylos, one of the regions invaded and subjected by the Dorians. Whether it had the ethnic meaning of ""the Dorian"" is unknown. Modern derivations of ""Dorians"" do not depend on a figure of Dorus: see Name of the Dorians. Centuries later, the figure of Dorus was invoked by Diodorus Siculus in the common way to explain the presence in Crete during the historical period of Dorian cities of mixed population: An important descendance of aristocratic clans, some of which survived into Classical times, was from Heracles.

"Kuusankoski is a neighborhood of city of Kouvola, former industrial town and municipality of Finland, located in the region of Kymenlaakso in the province of Southern Finland. The population of Kuusankoski was 20,392 (2003) and the total area was 129.5 km² of which 114 km² was land and 14.56 km² water. It is located some 130 kilometres (80 mi) northeast of the Finnish capital Helsinki. Kuusankoski is primarily known for paper manufacturing and three large factory complexes. It is sometimes nicknamed the ""Paper capital of Finland"". Kuusankoski (as a municipality, not the settlement), was founded in 1921 from the parts of neighbouring Iitti and Valkeala. It gained the status of kauppala (literally ""a place of commerce"") in 1957 and became a town in 1973. The history of Kuusankoski during the last one and a half centuries has been closely linked to the establishment of the paper factories and their development. The establishment of the factories dates back to the 1870s and 1890s, when the rapids of the river Kymijoki were made to deliver electricity to a waking industry. Since then, and until the modern age of automation, the factories have offered jobs to many generations of Kuusankoski citizens, making the area somewhat more prosperous than the neighbouring regions. Today, the influence of the factories on everyday life has somewhat lessened, but their historical importance remains well known. The cityscape of Kuusankoski consists mostly of element-based blocks of flats built during the 1960s. However, there are some exceptions, such as a school and a church built at the beginning of the last century. Another kind of architecture is represented by the culture building Kuusankoskitalo, a typical creation of modern Finnish architecture, and a library built in a functionalistic style. The cityscape is also characterised by the beautiful river Kymijoki which curves through the town. Footballer Sami Hyypiä is from Kuusankoski.Another famous person living in this town is ex-Nightwish singer Tarja Turunen As of 2009, the six municipalities – Kouvola, Kuusankoski, Elimäki, Anjalankoski, Valkeala and Jaala – were consolidated, accounting for the new municipality of Kouvola with a population of over 80,000, being the 10th largest city in Finland.","[('Kuusankoski', 'Kouvola', 'city', 'P131'), ('Kuusankoski', 'Kouvola', 'town', 'P131'), ('Kuusankoski', 'Kymenlaakso', 'city', 'P131'), ('Kuusankoski', 'Kymenlaakso', 'town', 'P131'), ('Kouvola', 'Kymenlaakso', 'city', 'P131'), ('Kouvola', 'Kymenlaakso', 'town', 'P131'), ('Kymenlaakso', 'Southern Finland', 'city', 'P131'), ('Kymenlaakso', 'Southern Finland', 'town', 'P131'), ('Southern Finland', 'Finland', 'city', 'P131'), ('Southern Finland', 'Finland', 'town', 'P131'), ('Kuusankoski', 'Kouvola', 'city', 'P131'), ('Kuusankoski', 'Kouvola', 'town', 'P131'), ('Kuusankoski', 'Kouvola', 'city', 'P131'), ('Kuusankoski', 'Kouvola', 'town', 'P131'), ('Anjalankoski', 'Kouvola', 'city', 'P131'), ('Anjalankoski', 'Kouvola', 'town', 'P131'), ('Anjalankoski', 'Kouvola', 'city', 'P131'), ('Anjalankoski', 'Kouvola', 'town', 'P131'), ('Valkeala', 'Kouvola', 'city', 'P131'), ('Valkeala', 'Kouvola', 'town', 'P131'), ('Valkeala', 'Kouvola', 'city', 'P131'), ('Valkeala', 'Kouvola', 'town', 'P131'), ('Jaala', 'Kouvola', 'city', 'P131'), ('Jaala', 'Kouvola', 'town', 'P131'), ('Jaala', 'Kouvola', 'city', 'P131'), ('Jaala', 'Kouvola', 'town', 'P131')]","['Kuusankoski is a neighborhood of city of Kouvola, former industrial town and municipality of Finland, located in the region of Kymenlaakso in the province of Southern Finland.', 'The population of Kuusankoski was 20,392 (2003) and the total area was 129.5 km² of which 114 km² was land and 14.56 km² water.', 'It is located some 130 kilometres (80 mi) northeast of the Finnish capital Helsinki.', 'Kuusankoski is primarily known for paper manufacturing and three large factory complexes.', 'It is sometimes nicknamed the ""Paper capital of Finland"".', 'Kuusankoski (as a municipality, not the settlement), was founded in 1921 from the parts of neighbouring Iitti and Valkeala.', 'It gained the status of kauppala (literally ""a place of commerce"") in 1957 and became a town in 1973.', 'The history of Kuusankoski during the last one and a half centuries has been closely linked to the establishment of the paper factories and their development.', 'The establishment of the factories dates back to the 1870s and 1890s, when the rapids of the river Kymijoki were made to deliver electricity to a waking industry.', 'Since then, and until the modern age of automation, the factories have offered jobs to many generations of Kuusankoski citizens, making the area somewhat more prosperous than the neighbouring regions.', 'Today, the influence of the factories on everyday life has somewhat lessened, but their historical importance remains well known.', 'The cityscape of Kuusankoski consists mostly of element-based blocks of flats built during the 1960s.', 'However, there are some exceptions, such as a school and a church built at the beginning of the last century.', 'Another kind of architecture is represented by the culture building Kuusankoskitalo, a typical creation of modern Finnish architecture, and a library built in a functionalistic style.', 'The cityscape is also characterised by the beautiful river Kymijoki which curves through the town.', 'Footballer Sami Hyypiä is from Kuusankoski.Another famous person living in this town is ex-Nightwish singer Tarja Turunen As of 2009, the six municipalities – Kouvola, Kuusankoski, Elimäki, Anjalankoski, Valkeala and Jaala – were consolidated, accounting for the new municipality of Kouvola with a population of over 80,000, being the 10th largest city in Finland.']",16,364,54
"Belus or Belos in classical Greek or classical Latin texts (and later material based on them) in an Assyrian context refers to one or another purportedly ancient and historically mythical Assyrian king, such king in part at least a euhemerization of the Babylonian god Bel Marduk. Belus most commonly appears as the father of Ninus, who otherwise mostly appears as the first known Assyrian king. Ctesias provides no information about Ninus' parentage. But already in Herodotus there is a Ninus son of Belus among the ancestors of the Heraclid dynasty of Lydia, though here Belus is strangely and uniquely made a grandson of Heracles. See Omphale for discussion. A fragment by Castor of Rhodes, preserved only in the Armenian translation of Eusebius of Caesarea, makes Belus king of Assyria at the time when Zeus and the other gods fought first the Titans and then the giants. Castor says Belus was considered a god after his death, but that he does not know how many years Belus reigned. Belus elsewhere is a vague, ancestral figure. It was suggested in The Two Babylons by Alexander Hislop that he was originally a conqueror who fathered king Ninus the first, and that after Ninus' death his wife Semiramis began to claim Ninus as a Sun god, Cush (Belus) as the Lord God, herself as the mother goddess and her son Tammuz as the god of love, in an effort to control her subjects better after the death of her husband, and to allow her to rule as her newborn son's regent. Some versions of the tale of Adonis make Adonis the son of Theias or Thias the King of Assyria, who is the son of Belus. Ovid's Metamorphoses (4.212f) speaks of King Orchamus who ruled the Achaemenid cities of Persia as the 7th in line from ancient Belus the founder. But no other extant sources mention either Orchamus or his daughters Leucothoe and Clytie. Nonnus in his Dionysiaca (18.5f) brings in King Staphylus of Assyria and his son Botrys who entertain Dionysus, characters unknown elsewhere. Staphylus claims to be grandson of Belus. Diodorus Siculus (6.5.1) introduces the Roman god Picus (normally son of Saturn) as a king of Italy and calls him brother of Ninus (and therefore perhaps son of Belus). The odd connection between Picus and Ninus reappears in John of Nikiû's Chronicle (6.2f) which relates that Cronus was the first king of Assyria and Persia, that he married an Assyrian woman named Rhea and that she bore him Picus (who was also called Zeus) and Ninus who founded the city of Ninus (Nineveh). Cronus removed to Italy but was then slain by his son Zeus Picus because he devoured his children. Then Zeus became the father of Belus by his own sister. After the disappearance of Zeus Picus (who apparently reigned over both Italy and Assyria), Belus son of Zeus Picus succeeded to the throne in Assyria (later Faunus who is elsewhere always the son of Picus reigns in Italy before moving to Egypt and turning into Hermes Trismegistus father of Hephaestus). Upon the death of Belus, his uncle Ninus became king and then married his own mother who was previously called Rhea but is now reintroduced under the name of Semiramis. It is explained that from that time on this custom was maintained so that Persians allegedly thought nothing of taking a mother or sister or daughter as a wife. Later historians and chronographers make no mention of such stories. They either do not mention Belus at all or accept him as father of Ninus.

"The state coat of arms of Ukraine (Ukrainian: Державний Герб України), officially referred to as the Sign of Princely State of Volodymyr the Great (Constitution of Ukraine, Article 20) or commonly the Tryzub (Ukrainian: Тризуб, ""trident"") is the national coat of arms of Ukraine, featuring the same colors found on the Ukrainian flag; a blue shield with a gold trident. It appears on the Presidential standard of Ukraine. Blue colored tridents are considered to be irregular representation by the Ukrainian Heraldry Society. The small coat of arms was officially adopted on 19 February 1992, while constitutional provisions exist for establishing the great coat of arms, which is not yet officially adopted. The small coat of arms was designed by Andriy Grechylo, Olexiy Kokhan and Ivan Turetskyi. It is a representation of the seal-trident of Volodymyr the Great. The Great coat of arms which has not been adopted consists of the small coat of arms and the coat of arms of Zaporizhian Host (Constitution of Ukraine, Article 20). The trident was not thought of as a national symbol until 1917, when one of the most prominent Ukrainian historians, Mykhailo Hrushevsky, proposed to adopt it as a national symbol (alongside other variants, including an arbalet, a bow or a Kozak carrying a musket, i.e. images that carried considerable historical and cultural and heraldic significance for Ukraine). On 22 March 1918, the Central Rada (parliament) adopted it as the coat of arms of the short-lived Ukrainian People's Republic.

"The City of Kiev has a unique legal status compared to the other administrative subdivisions of Ukraine. The most significant difference is that the city is functionally independent of the oblast (province) which it located in. That is, Kiev is subordinated directly to the national-level branches of the Government of Ukraine, skipping the provincial level authorities of Kiev Oblast, but hosting the administrative and infrastructure bodies for the latter. The unique standing of the city's institutions of self-governance reflects the role of Kyiv as the capital of Ukraine and is also based on the city's historical administrative status within the Soviet Union where Kiev held the position of a City of republican subordination. The head of the local government (the Mayor of Kiev) is elected, rather than appointed, and the municipal government has greater latitude in local affairs that elsewhere in Ukraine. The President of Ukraine appoints the Head of Kiev City Administration. Presently, the Kiev City Council Secretary and Deputy Mayor Galyna Gerega is the acting Mayor of Kiev, (Acting) Head of Kiev City Administration is Anatoliy Holubchenko since 14 December 2013. Currently, the legal status and the local government of Kyiv is regulated by the special provisions of the Constitution of Ukraine as well as a combination of Ukrainian laws, namely the Law on the capital of Ukraine - Hero City Kiev, the Law on the local state administration and the Law on local self-governance in Ukraine. Its special administrative status is recognized in the Ukrainian Constitution in Chapter IX: Territorial Structure of Ukraine and is governed in accordance with laws passed by Ukraine's parliament, the Verkhovna Rada. The scope and structure of the Kiev local government and the status of the current Kiev City Council is the subject of an ongoing bitter legal and political crisis.

"The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has given Academy Awards to actors and actresses for their performances in films since its inception. Throughout the history of the Academy Awards, there have been actors and actresses who have received multiple Academy Awards for Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor, or Best Supporting Actress. The only restriction is that actors cannot receive multiple nominations for the same performance. This rule was implemented after Barry Fitzgerald received a Best Actor and a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his performance in Going My Way. As of 2015, 40 actors and actresses have received two or more Academy Awards in acting categories. Six of these actors and actresses have received three or more acting Academy Awards: Katharine Hepburn (four Best Actress awards), Ingrid Bergman (two Best Actress awards and one Best Supporting Actress award), Walter Brennan (three Best Supporting Actor awards), Jack Nicholson (two Best Actor awards and one Best Supporting Actor award), Meryl Streep (two Best Actress awards and one Best Supporting Actress award), and Daniel Day-Lewis (three Best Actor awards). Brennan was the first to receive three or more Academy Awards in 1940, followed by Hepburn in 1968, Bergman in 1974, Nicholson in 1997, Streep in 2011, and most recently Day-Lewis in 2012.

"Paul Theodor Uhlenhuth (7 January 1870 in Hanover – 13 December 1957 in Freiburg im Breisgau) was a German bacteriologist and immunologist, and Professor at the University of Strasbourg (1911–1918), at the University of Marburg (1918–1923) and at the University of Freiburg (1923–1936). He was rector of the University of Freiburg 1928–1929. After his retirement in 1936, he led his own research institute in Freiburg, known as the State Research Laboratory, until his death in 1957. He is famous in the annals of forensic science for developing the species precipitin test which could distinguish human blood from animal blood in 1901, a discovery which had tremendous importance in criminal justice in the 20th century. In 1915, he discovered the pathogen of Weil's disease. He also invented the arsenic treatment of syphilis and the antimony treatment of many tropical diseases, and was an influential promoter of cancer research. He was a recipient of numerous honours, and was a member of the Academy of Sciences Leopoldina and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Medicine several times, notably by Nobel laureate Karl Landsteiner.

"Belgian nationalism or Belgicism (Dutch: Belgicisme; French: Belgicanisme) is a nationalist ideology that favours the reversal of federalism and the creation of a unitary state in Belgium. The ideology advocates reduced or no autonomy for the Flemish Community who constitute Flanders, the French Community of Belgium and the German-speaking Community of Belgium who constitute Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region which is inhabited by both Walloons and Flemings, and the dissolution of the regional counterparts of each ethnic group within Belgium. It insists on restoring total sovereignty to the level of the Belgian state by reverting Belgium to a unitary state, after decades of state structure reforms that made Belgium a federal state since the 1970s - contrary to Flemish nationalists who advocate independence of their region, and Walloon, Brussels and German-speaking regionalists who advocate more autonomy to their respective regions. Belgian nationalists advocate the unity between all language groups in Belgium, and condemn each perceived chauvinistic or linguistic discrimination, advocate the knowledge of all official languages (Dutch, French, German) and a multicultural, tolerant, strong feeling of citizenship. Belgian nationalism is mainly supported by French-speaking politicians, alongside some socialists, certain circles in Brussels and some sections of the far right. Because the majority in Flanders do not favor independence of their region[contradictory] and because both the Wallonia and Brussels regions and the German community are strongly regionalist, there is no popular support for Belgian nationalism in any region of Belgium, and political parties that support this ideology openly have not gained electoral support in recent years, so it remains much weaker than the secessionist and regional nationalisms of the ethnic groups.","[('Dutch', 'Belgium', 'state', 'P17'), ('Flemish nationalists', 'Belgian', 'state', 'P17'), ('Flemish nationalists', 'Belgian', 'state', 'P17'), ('Flemish nationalists', 'Belgian', 'state', 'P17'), ('Flemish nationalists', 'Belgian', 'state', 'P17'), ('Flemish nationalists', 'Belgium', 'state', 'P17'), ('Flemish nationalists', 'Belgium', 'state', 'P17'), ('Flemish nationalists', 'Belgium', 'state', 'P17'), ('Flemish nationalists', 'Belgium', 'state', 'P17'), ('Flemish nationalists', 'Belgium', 'state', 'P17'), ('Flemish nationalists', 'Belgium', 'state', 'P17'), ('Flemish nationalists', 'Belgium', 'state', 'P17'), ('Flemish nationalists', 'Belgium', 'state', 'P17'), ('Walloon', 'Belgian', 'state', 'P17'), ('Walloon', 'Belgian', 'state', 'P17'), ('Walloon', 'Belgian', 'state', 'P17'), ('Walloon', 'Belgian', 'state', 'P17'), ('Walloon', 'Belgium', 'state', 'P17'), ('Walloon', 'Belgium', 'state', 'P17'), ('Walloon', 'Belgium', 'state', 'P17'), ('Walloon', 'Belgium', 'state', 'P17'), ('Walloon', 'Belgium', 'state', 'P17'), ('Walloon', 'Belgium', 'state', 'P17'), ('Walloon', 'Belgium', 'state', 'P17'), ('Walloon', 'Belgium', 'state', 'P17'), ('Brussels', 'Belgian', 'state', 'P17'), ('Brussels', 'Belgian', 'state', 'P17'), ('Brussels', 'Belgian', 'state', 'P17'), ('Brussels', 'Belgian', 'state', 'P17'), ('Brussels', 'Belgium', 'state', 'P17'), ('Brussels', 'Belgium', 'state', 'P17'), ('Brussels', 'Belgium', 'state', 'P17'), ('Brussels', 'Belgium', 'state', 'P17'), ('Brussels', 'Belgium', 'state', 'P17'), ('Brussels', 'Belgium', 'state', 'P17'), ('Brussels', 'Belgium', 'state', 'P17'), ('Brussels', 'Belgium', 'state', 'P17'), ('It', 'Belgian', 'state', 'P17'), ('It', 'Belgian', 'state', 'P17'), ('It', 'Belgian', 'state', 'P17'), ('It', 'Belgian', 'state', 'P17'), ('It', 'Belgium', 'state', 'P17'), ('It', 'Belgium', 'state', 'P17'), ('It', 'Belgium', 'state', 'P17'), ('It', 'Belgium', 'state', 'P17'), ('It', 'Belgium', 'state', 'P17'), ('It', 'Belgium', 'state', 'P17'), ('It', 'Belgium', 'state', 'P17'), ('It', 'Belgium', 'state', 'P17')]","['Belgian nationalism or Belgicism (Dutch: Belgicisme; French: Belgicanisme) is a nationalist ideology that favours the reversal of federalism and the creation of a unitary state in Belgium.', 'The ideology advocates reduced or no autonomy for the Flemish Community who constitute Flanders, the French Community of Belgium and the German-speaking Community of Belgium who constitute Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region which is inhabited by both Walloons and Flemings, and the dissolution of the regional counterparts of each ethnic group within Belgium.', 'It insists on restoring total sovereignty to the level of the Belgian state by reverting Belgium to a unitary state, after decades of state structure reforms that made Belgium a federal state since the 1970s - contrary to Flemish nationalists who advocate independence of their region, and Walloon, Brussels and German-speaking regionalists who advocate more autonomy to their respective regions.', 'Belgian nationalists advocate the unity between all language groups in Belgium, and condemn each perceived chauvinistic or linguistic discrimination, advocate the knowledge of all official languages (Dutch, French, German) and a multicultural, tolerant, strong feeling of citizenship.', 'Belgian nationalism is mainly supported by French-speaking politicians, alongside some socialists, certain circles in Brussels and some sections of the far right.', 'Because the majority in Flanders do not favor independence of their region[contradictory] and because both the Wallonia and Brussels regions and the German community are strongly regionalist, there is no popular support for Belgian nationalism in any region of Belgium, and political parties that support this ideology openly have not gained electoral support in recent years, so it remains much weaker than the secessionist and regional nationalisms of the ethnic groups.']",6,472,71
"Fernando Sancho (January 7, 1916 – July 31, 1990) was a Spanish actor. Sancho was born in Zaragoza, Aragón, Spain, and died in Madrid after surgery. He was often typecast as a Mexican bandit in paella and spaghetti westerns, including The Big Gundown (directed by Sergio Sollima), A Pistol for Ringo and Return of Ringo (directed by Duccio Tessari), Arizona Colt (directed by Michele Lupo), Minnesota Clay (directed by Sergio Corbucci), and Sartana (directed by Gianfranco Parolini). Though (almost) always given the same role — a Mexican bandit chief — Sancho was a strong actor, and became one of the icons of these films. He also appeared in a number of Spanish horror movies in the '60s and '70s. One of the better known horror parts was the role of a corrupt small town mayor in El Ataque de los Muertos sin Ojos (AKA Return of the Blind Dead), directed by Amando de Ossorio. Another notable horror film was Orloff and the Invisible Man (1971), directed by Pierre Chevalier and starring Howard Vernon, an unofficial continuation of the Dr. Orloff saga begun by Jess Franco in The Awful Dr. Orloff (1962). Sancho also turned up briefly in the epic Lawrence of Arabia playing the Turkish sergeant who arrests T. E. Lawrence in Deraa. Sancho had a prolific career and remained active in film up to his death. He made larger than life characters his specialty, and was a similarly 'big' character off screen as well — popular both with audiences and with his fellow actors.","[('The Big Gundown', 'Sergio Sollima', 'directed by', 'P57'), ('The Big Gundown', 'Sergio Sollima', 'directed by', 'P57'), ('The Big Gundown', 'Sergio Sollima', 'directed by', 'P57'), ('The Big Gundown', 'Sergio Sollima', 'directed by', 'P57'), ('The Big Gundown', 'Sergio Sollima', 'directed by', 'P57'), ('Ringo', 'Duccio Tessari', 'directed by', 'P57'), ('Ringo', 'Duccio Tessari', 'directed by', 'P57'), ('Ringo', 'Duccio Tessari', 'directed by', 'P57'), ('Ringo', 'Duccio Tessari', 'directed by', 'P57'), ('Ringo', 'Duccio Tessari', 'directed by', 'P57'), ('Ringo', 'Duccio Tessari', 'directed by', 'P57'), ('Ringo', 'Duccio Tessari', 'directed by', 'P57'), ('Ringo', 'Duccio Tessari', 'directed by', 'P57'), ('Ringo', 'Duccio Tessari', 'directed by', 'P57'), ('Ringo', 'Duccio Tessari', 'directed by', 'P57'), ('Arizona Colt', 'Michele Lupo', 'directed by', 'P57'), ('Arizona Colt', 'Michele Lupo', 'directed by', 'P57'), ('Arizona Colt', 'Michele Lupo', 'directed by', 'P57'), ('Arizona Colt', 'Michele Lupo', 'directed by', 'P57'), ('Arizona Colt', 'Michele Lupo', 'directed by', 'P57'), ('Minnesota Clay', 'Sergio Corbucci', 'directed by', 'P57'), ('Minnesota Clay', 'Sergio Corbucci', 'directed by', 'P57'), ('Minnesota Clay', 'Sergio Corbucci', 'directed by', 'P57'), ('Minnesota Clay', 'Sergio Corbucci', 'directed by', 'P57'), ('Minnesota Clay', 'Sergio Corbucci', 'directed by', 'P57')]","['Fernando Sancho (January 7, 1916 – July 31, 1990) was a Spanish actor.', 'Sancho was born in Zaragoza, Aragón, Spain, and died in Madrid after surgery.', 'He was often typecast as a Mexican bandit in paella and spaghetti westerns, including The Big Gundown (directed by Sergio Sollima), A Pistol for Ringo and Return of Ringo (directed by Duccio Tessari), Arizona Colt (directed by Michele Lupo), Minnesota Clay (directed by Sergio Corbucci), and Sartana (directed by Gianfranco Parolini).', 'Though (almost) always given the same role — a Mexican bandit chief — Sancho was a strong actor, and became one of the icons of these films.', ""He also appeared in a number of Spanish horror movies in the '60s and '70s."", 'One of the better known horror parts was the role of a corrupt small town mayor in El Ataque de los Muertos sin Ojos (AKA Return of the Blind Dead), directed by Amando de Ossorio.', 'Another notable horror film was Orloff and the Invisible Man (1971), directed by Pierre Chevalier and starring Howard Vernon, an unofficial continuation of the Dr. Orloff saga begun by Jess Franco in The Awful Dr. Orloff (1962).', 'Sancho also turned up briefly in the epic Lawrence of Arabia playing the Turkish sergeant who arrests T.

"Johann Strauss III (February 16, 1866 – January 9, 1939; German: Johann Strauß III; also known as Johann Eduard Strauss) was an Austrian composer whose father was Eduard Strauss, whose uncles were Johann Strauss II & Josef Strauss, and whose grandfather was Johann Strauss I. He was unofficially entrusted with the task of upholding his family's tradition after the dissolution of the Strauss Orchestra by his father in 1901. His talents were not fully realised during his lifetime as musical tastes had changed in the Silver Age with more popular composers such as Franz Lehár and Oscar Straus dominating the Viennese musical scene with their operettas, although his uncle, Johann Strauss II, supervised his development as a musician, a fact disputed by Eduard Strauss. Despite his keen interest in composing, he was better remembered as a conductor. His only stage work, the three-act operetta Katze und Maus, composed in 1898, premiered in Vienna on 23 December 1898, at the Theater an der Wien. Its public reaction bordered on utter dislike, and music critics called for the distraught composer to reassess himself and to appear under a pseudonym, in order not to tarnish the name of his famous relatives. He salvaged the music score and produced independent pieces of which the waltzes Sylvianen Op. 1 and Leonie Op. 2 survived obscurity. He also conducted from the violin in the style of the Vorgeiger and of his family. In 1903, he elevated the Strauss family to a new age of development when the Deutsche Grammophon AG of Germany recorded his conducting of the Johann Strauss Orchestra on eight single-sided records of works by his family. Principally, he was the first conductor in the Strauss family to actively conduct works to be recorded by prominent recording companies. His later works, such as Dem Muthigen gehört die Welt (The World Belongs to the Brave), Op. 25, and Krönungs-Walzer (Coronation Waltz), Op. 40, (the latter celebrating the coronation of King Edward VII) were also considerably more popular than his earlier efforts.

"The Kingdom of Sardinia was a state in Europe from the early 14th until the mid-19th century. It was the predecessor state of today's Italy. A small state with weak institutions when it was acquired by the Duke of Savoy in 1720, the Savoyards united their insular and continental domains and built Sardinia—often called Piedmont-Sardinia in this period—into one of the great powers by the time of the Crimean War (1853–56). Its final capital was Turin, the centre of Savoyard power since the Middle Ages. The kingdom initially consisted of the islands of Corsica and Sardinia, sovereignty over both of which was claimed by the Papacy, which granted them as a fief, the regnum Sardiniae et Corsicae (""kingdom of Sardinia and Corsica""), to King James II of Aragon in 1297. Beginning in 1324, James and his successors conquered the island of Sardinia and established de facto their de jure authority. In 1420 the last competing claim to the island was bought out. After the union of the crowns of Aragon and Castile, Sardinia became a part of the burgeoning Spanish Empire. In 1720 it was ceded by the Habsburg and Bourbon claimants to the Spanish throne to Duke Victor Amadeus II of Savoy. The kingdom of Sardinia came to be progressively identified with the entire domain ruled by the House of Savoy, which included, besides Savoy and Aosta, dynastic possessions since the 11th century, the Principality of Piedmont (a possession built up in the 13th century), and the County of Nice (a possession since 1388). While the traditional capital of the island of Sardinia and seat of its viceroys was Cagliari, the Piedmontese city of Turin was the de facto capital of the House of Savoy. When the mainland domains of the House of Savoy were occupied and eventually annexed by Napoleonic France, the king of Sardinia made his permanent residence on the island for the first time in its history. The Congress of Vienna (1814–15), which restructured Europe after Napoleon's defeat, returned to Savoy its mainland possessions and augmented them with Liguria, taken from the Republic of Genoa. In 1847–48, in a ""perfect fusion"", the various Savoyard states were unified under one legal system, with the capital in Turin, and granted a constitution, the Statuto Albertino. There followed the annexation of Lombardy (1859), the central Italian states and the Two Sicilies (1860), Venetia (1866), and the Papal States (1870). On 17 March 1861, to more accurately reflect its new geographic extent, the Kingdom of Sardinia changed its name to the Kingdom of Italy, and its capital was eventually moved first to Florence and then to Rome.","[('Sardinia', 'Cagliari', 'capital', 'P36'), ('Sardinia', 'Cagliari', 'capital', 'P36'), ('Sardinia', 'Cagliari', 'capital', 'P36'), ('Sardinia', 'Cagliari', 'capital', 'P36'), ('Sardinia', 'Turin', 'capital', 'P36'), ('Sardinia', 'Turin', 'capital', 'P36'), ('Sardinia', 'Turin', 'capital', 'P36'), ('Sardinia', 'Turin', 'capital', 'P36'), ('Cagliari', 'Sardinia', 'capital of', 'P1376'), ('Cagliari', 'Sardinia', 'capital of', 'P1376'), ('Cagliari', 'Piedmontese', 'capital of', 'P1376'), ('Cagliari', 'Piedmontese', 'capital of', 'P1376'), ('Piedmontese', 'Cagliari', 'capital', 'P36'), ('Piedmontese', 'Cagliari', 'capital', 'P36'), ('Piedmontese', 'Cagliari', 'capital', 'P36'), ('Piedmontese', 'Cagliari', 'capital', 'P36'), ('Piedmontese', 'Turin', 'capital', 'P36'), ('Piedmontese', 'Turin', 'capital', 'P36'), ('Piedmontese', 'Turin', 'capital', 'P36'), ('Piedmontese', 'Turin', 'capital', 'P36'), ('Turin', 'Sardinia', 'capital of', 'P1376'), ('Turin', 'Sardinia', 'capital of', 'P1376'), ('Turin', 'Piedmontese', 'capital of', 'P1376'), ('Turin', 'Piedmontese', 'capital of', 'P1376'), ('Italy', 'Florence', 'capital', 'P36')]","['The Kingdom of Sardinia was a state in Europe from the early 14th until the mid-19th century.', ""It was the predecessor state of today's Italy."", 'A small state with weak institutions when it was acquired by the Duke of Savoy in 1720, the Savoyards united their insular and continental domains and built Sardinia—often called Piedmont-Sardinia in this period—into one of the great powers by the time of the Crimean War (1853–56).', 'Its final capital was Turin, the centre of Savoyard power since the Middle Ages.', 'The kingdom initially consisted of the islands of Corsica and Sardinia, sovereignty over both of which was claimed by the Papacy, which granted them as a fief, the regnum Sardiniae et Corsicae (""kingdom of Sardinia and Corsica""), to King James II of Aragon in 1297.', 'Beginning in 1324, James and his successors conquered the island of Sardinia and established de facto their de jure authority.', 'In 1420 the last competing claim to the island was bought out.', 'After the union of the crowns of Aragon and Castile, Sardinia became a part of the burgeoning Spanish Empire.', 'In 1720 it was ceded by the Habsburg and Bourbon claimants to the Spanish throne to Duke Victor Amadeus II of Savoy.', 'The kingdom of Sardinia came to be progressively identified with the entire domain ruled by the House of Savoy, which included, besides Savoy and Aosta, dynastic possessions since the 11th century, the Principality of Piedmont (a possession built up in the 13th century), and the County of Nice (a possession since 1388).', 'While the traditional capital of the island of Sardinia and seat of its viceroys was Cagliari, the Piedmontese city of Turin was the de facto capital of the House of Savoy.', 'When the mainland domains of the House of Savoy were occupied and eventually annexed by Napoleonic France, the king of Sardinia made his permanent residence on the island for the first time in its history.', ""The Congress of Vienna (1814–15), which restructured Europe after Napoleon's defeat, returned to Savoy its mainland possessions and augmented them with Liguria, taken from the Republic of Genoa."", 'In 1847–48, in a ""perfect fusion"", the various Savoyard states were unified under one legal system, with the capital in Turin, and granted a constitution, the Statuto Albertino.', 'There followed the annexation of Lombardy (1859), the central Italian states and the Two Sicilies (1860), Venetia (1866), and the Papal States (1870).', 'On 17 March 1861, to more accurately reflect its new geographic extent, the Kingdom of Sardinia changed its name to the Kingdom of Italy, and its capital was eventually moved first to Florence and then to Rome.']",16,321,52

It is considered part of Central Africa. Burundi's capital is Bujumbura. The southwestern border is adjacent to Lake Tanganyika. The Twa, Hutu and Tutsi peoples have lived in Burundi for at least five hundred years. For more than 200 years, Burundi was an independent kingdom. At the beginning of the twentieth century, Germany colonized the region. After the First World War and Germany's defeat, it ceded the territory to Belgium. The Belgians ruled Burundi and Rwanda as a European colony known as Ruanda-Urundi. Their intervention exacerbated social differences between the Tutsi and Hutu, and contributed to political unrest in the region. Burundi gained independence in 1962 and initially had a monarchy, but a series of assassinations, coups, and a general climate of regional instability culminated in the establishment of a republic and one-party state in 1966. Bouts of ethnic cleansing and ultimately two civil wars and genocides during the 1970s and again in the 1990s left the country undeveloped and its population as one of the world's poorest. 2015 witnessed large-scale political strife as President Pierre Nkurunziza opted to run for a third term in office, a coup attempt failed and the country's parliamentary and presidential elections were broadly criticized by members of the international community.

"The 2008 breach of the Gaza-Egypt border began on 23 January after Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip set off an explosion near the Rafah border crossing, destroying part of the 2003 wall. The United Nations estimates that as many as half the 1.5 million population of the Gaza Strip crossed the border into Egypt seeking food and supplies. Due to fears that militants would acquire weapons in Egypt, Israeli police went on increased alert. Egypt had closed the Rafah border crossing in June 2007, days before the Hamas took control of Gaza at the end of the Fatah-Hamas conflict; The breach followed a blockade of the Gaza Strip by Israel beginning in part that same June, with fuel supply reductions in October 2007. A total blockade had begun on 17 January 2008 following a rise in rocket attacks on Israel emanating from Gaza. Although Israel demanded Egypt reseal the border due to security concerns, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak ordered his troops to allow crossings to alleviate the humanitarian crisis, while verifying that the Gazans did not attempt to bring weapons back into Gaza. In five days, Gazans spent some US$250 million in the North Sinai Governorate's capital of Arish alone. The sudden enormous demand there for staple products led to large local price rises and some shortages. On 24 January, the United Nations Human Rights Council condemned Israel for the fifteenth time in less than two years, calling the blockade collective punishment. However, the proceedings were boycotted by Israel and the United States. On 27 January, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert promised that Israel would no longer disrupt the supply of food, medicine and necessary energy into the Gaza Strip. Meanwhile, President Mubarak announced plans to meet separately with representatives of Hamas and Fatah in order to come to a new border control agreement. On 3 February, Gaza's Foreign minister, Mahmoud al-Zahar, announced that Hamas and Egypt would cooperate in controlling the border without Israeli control, ""perhaps jointly with Abbas"". Abbas' Government said that Egypt had agreed to restore the 2005 border agreement giving Abbas control over the Rafah crossing, but excluding Hamas.

"Broadbeach United Soccer Club are an Australian soccer club from Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. It is a club which was founded in 1962. The club's home ground is at Chelsea Avenue in the suburb of Broadbeach. The club competes in the Gold Coast Premier League, where it has been one of the leading sides for the past few decades. Club History The Broadbeach juniors were founded in 1970 with the S.S.B juniors disbanding when John Stainsby left Broadbeach Oval to form the Musgrave Soccer Club at Keith Hunt Park. Most of the founders of S.S.B stayed on board with the new club such as David Erwicker, Billy Massa, John Green,Carlo March Shirley Newman, Anne and Archie Shaw. Some stayed for a year or two, before leaving to other clubs. Rini Hendriks came on board with the juniors when his sons came and played for the Broadbeach juniors in 1971. Rini was also Gold Coast United's Brisbane delegate from 1971–79 and then became a Broadbeach United icon for many years. Rini watches his beloved Dolphins still to this day. Broadbeach seniors were founded in 1980, the year after Gold Coast United folded. With the formation of a new team called Gold Coast City to play in the Brisbane Premier League, and move away from Broadbeach oval, it left the possibility of Broadbeach oval having no senior team. However it was decided by people such as Dave Blake and Eddie Dwight that Broadbeach enter a team in the Gold Coast First Division. Many of its players stayed on from the Gold Coast Dolphins [Gold Coast United's 3rd team which started playing in the inaugural 1976 Gold Coast season]. In its first year, Broadbeach won the treble which included the Presidents Cup, Grand Final, and the Premiership trophy, beginning a wonderful tradition of stability and success.Broadbeach remain the only Gold Coast club not to be relegated. Success has been constant through the years and in 1995, the Broadbeach Dolphins won all 4 trophies on offer in a magnificent season, successive club championships in 1995, 1996 followed, and the Qantas Cup win in 1990 highlighted the dolphins winning culture. From 2005 to 2015, Broadbeach have won 6 Premierships, 6 Grand Finals and 3 Club Championships in arguably the clubs', and Gold Coast's best era, stamping itself with Palm Beach as the best club in Gold Coast history. In 2014, the clubs four Senior Teams (Premier Firsts, Premier Reserves, Veto Division 2 and Women's Premier) all done the League and Grand Final double, a feat unmatched by any other Gold Coast Club. Early pioneers of the club such as Dave Blake, Eddie Dwight, Carlo March, Micky Baker, Rini Hendriks, Terry Swift, Steve Bennett, Ronny Bell, Sharon Edwards and many others have started a magnificent history that has lasted for many years. In more modern times, the likes of Pat Hedges, Dave Rea, Mick and Steve Doyle, the Vernon family and the Broadfoot family have kept Broadbeach as a front runner in the modern era. Players have come and gone and there have been many great players that have played for this famous club including: Shane Smeltz - AFC Wimbledon (2005–06), Halifax Town (2006–07), New Zealand (National team), Wellington Phoenix, Gold Coast United, Perth Glory, Sydney FC Danny Milosevic - Leeds United (1999–2004), Celtic (2004) Des Gallagher - Stevenage Borough FC (1996–2000).

"Kosmos 2421 (Cosmos 2421) was a Russian spy satellite launched in 2006, but began fragmenting in early 2008. It also had the Konus-A gamma-ray burst experiment by the Yoffe FizTekh Institute. Three separate fragmentation events produced about 500 pieces of trackable debris, but about half of those had already re-entered by the fall of 2008. The International Space Station adjusted its orbit to avoid debris fragment 33246 from the Kosmos 2421 breakup. That piece was predicted to have a 1 in 72 chance of hitting the station without a change. Kosmos 2421 was in a higher orbit than ISS, so when ISS's apogee (high point of orbit) surpassed the debris field's perigee (low point of orbit), many fragments would cross ISS's orbit. Kosmos 2421 was launched on June 25, 2006 on a Tsyklon-2 from LC90 at Baykonur. Other designations are 2006-026A and NORAD 29247. It is a US-PU/Legenda type satellite, and was in a 65 degree, 93 minute circular orbit 410–430 km up. A fragment re-entered in August 2010. There have been 190 known satellite breakups between 1961 and 2006. Kosmos 2421 was one of the top ten space junk producing events up to 2012.

"Łupków Pass or Lupkov Pass (Polish: Przełęcz Łupkowska, Slovak: Lupkovský priesmyk) is a significant mountain pass in the Carpathian mountains on the border between Poland and Slovakia, and close to the western border of Ukraine. Its highest point rises 640 m above sea level. It is located just south of the village Łupków in Poland and east of Medzilaborce in Slovakia. Underneath the pass runs a railway tunnel 642 m long, straddling the border between Poland and Slovakia. The Łupków Pass separates the Low Beskids from the Bieszczady Mountains. The tunnel and the associated railway line were finished in 1874, to link Galicia with the rest of the Austro-Hungarian Empire across the Carpathian mountains. Given that it was such a vital communications link, the pass had considerable strategic importance. Łupków Pass was one of the strategically important Carpathian passes bitterly contested in battles on the Eastern Front of World War I during the winter of 1914/1915. An attempt to stand on the line of the Wisłok river and the Łupków Pass failed before renewed Austro-German attacks on 8 May 1915. The railway tunnel was demolished and rebuilt multiple times during both World Wars. It was rebuilt again in 1945 but saw little use afterwards.

"Sawtelle /sɔːˈtɛl/ is a district in the Westside of the city of Los Angeles, California, partially within the West Los Angeles subregion like the Palms district, that may refer to (1) a larger district that is part of the city of Los Angeles, (2) a smaller unincorporated area of the County of Los Angeles that by definition is not part of the municipality of Los Angeles, or (3) a combination of these, sometimes known as the Sawtelle area. The name ""Sawtelle"" has also been used to refer only to the Veterans Administration complex, including the modern hospital (West Los Angeles Medical Center) and north of Wilshire Boulevard, the former site of the historical Sawtelle Veterans Home and outbuildings. This area is on unincorporated land west of the Interstate 405 freeway. The entire Sawtelle area includes portions of zip codes 90049, 90064, and 90025 and all of zip code 90073 (a P.O. zip code within the 90025 area, used exclusively by the West Los Angeles Medical Center/Veterans Affairs Wadsworth Medical Hospital). The community was initially established in 1899 and named after a manager of the Pacific Land Company that initially was responsible for its development and promotion. The incorporated (i.e., municipal) area of Sawtelle, which lies to the south of the unincorporated area, includes the Sawtelle neighborhood, a 1.82-square-mile (4.7 km2) district of the city of Los Angeles. This district (see below for history), was at one time an independent municipality, but it was consolidated with Los Angeles in 1922. The area extends about 1.0 mi (1.6 km) to either side of Santa Monica Boulevard, running westward about 1.3 miles (2.1 km) from the California Interstate 405 freeway (San Diego Freeway) and Sawtelle Boulevard, toward the city of Santa Monica. Within this incorporated (city) district lies a Japanese American community and business district along Sawtelle Boulevard, as well as the Japanese Institute of Sawtelle. The city has put community signs Sawtelle Japantown for this area on April 1, 2015. The smaller unincorporated (nonmunicipal) area of Sawtelle, about half the area of the incorporated area, consists of 576.5 acres, or 0.90 sq mi (2.3 km2), and it is completely surrounded by the city of Los Angeles. On the south, the unincorporated area abuts the Sawtelle city district that is now a part of West Los Angeles and the greater city of Los Angeles. On the north, it is bordered by Brentwood and Westwood. This unincorporated area consists of six parcels near the intersection of the San Diego Freeway and Santa Monica Boulevard, owned either by the US government or the state of California. A private utility company owns the seventh parcel. This area is under the zoning and governmental control of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors within the Third Supervisorial District. This unincorporated area contains the major Wilshire Federal Building, the Los Angeles National Cemetery for veterans, the Wadsworth VA Hospital/West Los Angeles Medical Center, the site of a former major veterans home, and many smaller federal office buildings.","[('Sawtelle', 'Los Angeles, California', 'city', 'P131'), ('Sawtelle', 'Los Angeles, California', 'city', 'P131'), ('Sawtelle', 'Los

"United Nations Good Offices Mission in Afghanistan and Pakistan (UNGOMAP) was established in May 1988, during the Soviet war in Afghanistan, to assist in ensuring the implementation of the agreements on the settlement of the situation relating to Afghanistan and investigate and report possible violations of any of the provisions of the agreements. The United Nations Security Council confirmed its establishment in Resolution 622 (1988). By 15 August 1988, the Soviet military withdrew nearly 50 percent of its troops (some 50,000 men) from Afghanistan, evacuating 10 main garrisons and handing them over to the Afghan armed forces. Another 8 garrisons remained under Soviet control until the end of the pullout on 15 February 1989. UNGOMAP received numerous complaints from both Afghanistan and Pakistan of alleged violations of the Geneva accords. Afghanistan alleged political activities and propaganda hostile to the Government of Afghanistan taking place in Pakistan, border crossings of men and materiel from Pakistan to Afghanistan, cross-border firings, acts of sabotage, rocket attacks on major urban centres, violations of Afghan airspace by Pakistan aircraft, the continued presence in Pakistan of training camps and arms depots for Afghan opposition groups, and direct involvement by Pakistan military personnel inside Afghanistan, as well as restrictions placed on refugees who wished to return to Afghanistan. Pakistan's complaints included allegations of political activities and propaganda hostile to the Government of Pakistan, bombings and violations of its airspace by Afghan aircraft, acts of sabotage and cross-border firings, including the use of SCUD missiles against Pakistan territory. UNGOMAP made every effort to investigate complaints lodged by the two parties. However, a number of difficulties hampered the effectiveness of the work of the Mission's inspection teams. These included the rough nature of the terrain, the time which lapsed before many of the alleged incidents were reported, and the security conditions prevailing in the area of operation. UNGOMAP also maintained close cooperation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). In particular, it was ready to monitor the situation inside Afghanistan and inform UNHCR of the safety conditions necessary for the return and resettlement of refugees. Up to 5 million refugees were estimated to be living in Pakistan and Iran. However, because the fighting in Afghanistan continued, conditions remained unstable and only a limited number of refugees returned to Afghanistan. UNGOMAP's mandate formally ended on 15 March 1990.","[('Afghanistan', 'Pakistan', 'border', 'P47'), ('Afghanistan', 'Pakistan', 'border', 'P47'), ('Afghanistan', 'Pakistan', 'border', 'P47'),

"The process of immigration of ethnic non-Bulgarians to Bulgaria can be considered after the country's liberation from Ottoman rule and the restoration of the Bulgarian state in 1878. Following the Berlin Congress, the Russian Empire was forced to withdraw its troops from Bulgaria but left a large number of specialists and functionaries who assisted the formation of the Bulgarian army and state institutions. These included Russian officers and generals, such as general Leonid Sobolev, Bulgaria's prime minister 1882–1883, general Alexander Golovin, and functionaries like Sofia's first mayor Piotr Alabin. Almost all of them left Bulgaria after the break-up of relations with Russia in 1886. With the formation of the Principality of Bulgaria in 1878, foreign specialists, entrepreneurs, teachers, workers, and missionaries started arriving in Bulgaria and assisted the building of the new country after five centuries of foreign rule. They were notably from Austria-Hungary and Russia, as well as from Switzerland, Germany, Italy, France, the US and other European nations, who assisted in the modernisation of all aspects of life in the new Bulgarian state. Notable ethnic groups among them were the Czechs and Slovaks, such as Konstantin Josef Jireček, Hermann Škorpil, Karel Škorpil, Jiří Prošek, Ivan Mrkvička, Jaroslav Věšín. Among the temporary or permanent settlers were ethnic Jews, Germans and Austrians, Hungarians, Serbs and Montenegrins (settled in a few villages in northeastern Bulgaria), Croats, Slovenes, Poles, Ukrainians and Rusyns, and others. Czechs, Slovaks, Rusyns and Germans of Protestant and Catholic denomination from Austria-Hungary founded or settled in villages in northern Bulgaria, such as Voyvodovo, Vratsa Province, Martvitsa (Slovak Mŕtvica, now Podem), Gorna Mitropolia, Brashlyanitsa. The relative freedom of religion allowed Catholic workers and missionaries and Protestant missionaries, mostly from the United States and Great Britain, to establish missions and live for shorter or longer periods in Bulgaria. The first larger compact group of non-Bulgarian immigrants in contemporary Bulgarian history to settle in the country were the Armenian refugees fleeing the persecutions in the Ottoman Empire. Their settlement started in the 1890s and expanded during the time of the Armenian genocide. A large wave of Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians and other nationals of the Russian Empire settled temporarily or permanently in Bulgaria following the demise of Wrangel's army in Crimea in 1920. A smaller wave of new immigrants arrived to Bulgaria during the socialist regime (1944–1989), where large numbers of foreign students came to study in Bulgarian universities and many of them remained. Most of them married Bulgarian nationals and settled in the country. Also at that time, many Bulgarians married citizens of the then Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc. The fall of communism at the end of 1989 saw greater migration to Bulgaria, when large groups of Chinese, Arabs, Russians, Ukrainians, Turks, Vietnamese, Albanians, a number of Armenians from the Republic of Armenia, some Africans, and an increasing number of EU nationals established themselves permanently in Bulgaria. The country's accession to the EU on January 1, 2007 has not yet led to a significant rise in immigrants, although there is a growth in the number of refugees from Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Sub-Saharan Africa, Armenia and some Christian Palestinians. The slow procedures of granting asylum and refugee status, the low living standard compared to the EU average and the postponement of entry to the Schengen area contribute to the low number of refugees and asylum seekers. The recent decade saw a growth of private businesses opened by citizens of Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, China, Bosnia and Herzegovina and the countries in the Middle East, notably Syria and Lebanon. Also during the last decade, Russian, Ukrainian, EU and US citizens purchased holiday properties along the Black sea coast, as well as in the interior. According to official data, the number of permanent foreign residents in Bulgaria as at 31.12.2008 is 66,806 and the vast majority of these come from Russia (21,309), Ukraine (5,350), the Republic of Macedonia (4,375), Turkey (3,828) and Moldova (2.203). This number does not include immigrants who have already obtained Bulgarian citizenship or illegal immigrants. The number of immigrants in Bulgaria was expected to grow as a result of the accession of Bulgaria in the European Union in 2007. Since the beginning of the Syrian Civil War in 2011, the number of Syrian refugees in Bulgaria grew. Together with the Syrian refugee families, many illegal migrants, mainly males, from countries like Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Eritrea, Somalia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq entered illegally through the Bulgarian-Turkish border.","[('Bulgarian', 'Bulgaria', 'country', 'P17'), ('Bulgarian', 'Bulgaria', 'state', 'P17'), ('Syrian', 'Iraq', 'border', 'P47'),

"France (French: [fʁɑ̃s]), officially the French Republic (French: République française [ʁepyblik fʁɑ̃sɛz]), is a sovereign state comprising territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European part of France, called metropolitan France, extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. France spans 643,801 square kilometres (248,573 sq mi) and has a total population of 66.6 million. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. The Constitution of France establishes the state as secular and democratic, with its sovereignty derived from the people. During the Iron Age, what is now Metropolitan France was inhabited by the Gauls, a Celtic people. The Gauls were conquered in 51 BC by the Roman Empire, which held Gaul until 486. The Gallo-Romans faced raids and migration from the Germanic Franks, who dominated the region for hundreds of years, eventually creating the medieval Kingdom of France. France emerged as a major European power in the Late Middle Ages, with its victory in the Hundred Years' War (1337 to 1453) strengthening French state-building and paving the way for a future centralized absolute monarchy. During the Renaissance, France experienced a vast cultural development and established the beginning of a global colonial empire. The 16th century was dominated by religious civil wars between Catholics and Protestants (Huguenots). France became Europe's dominant cultural, political, and military power under Louis XIV. French philosophers played a key role in the Age of Enlightenment during the 18th century. In the late 18th century, the absolute monarchy was overthrown in the French Revolution. Among its legacies was the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, one of the earliest documents on human rights, which expresses the nation's ideals to this day. France became one of modern history's earliest republics until Napoleon took power and launched the First French Empire in 1804. Fighting against a complex set of coalitions during the Napoleonic Wars, he dominated European affairs for over a decade and had a long-lasting impact on Western culture. Following the collapse of the Empire, France endured a tumultuous succession of governments: the monarchy was restored, it was replaced in 1830 by a constitutional monarchy, then briefly by a Second Republic, and then by a Second Empire, until a more lasting French Third Republic was established in 1870. The French republic had tumultuous relationships with the Catholic Church from the dechristianization of France during the French Revolution to the 1905 law establishing laïcité. Laïcité is a strict but consensual form of secularism, which is nowadays an important federative principle in the modern French society. France reached its territorial height during the 19th and early 20th centuries, when it ultimately possessed the second-largest colonial empire in the world. In World War I, France was one of the main winners as part of the Triple Entente alliance fighting against the Central Powers. France was also one of the Allied Powers in World War II, but came under occupation by the Axis Powers in 1940. Following liberation in 1944, a Fourth Republic was established and later dissolved in the course of the Algerian War. The Fifth Republic, led by Charles de Gaulle, was formed in 1958 and remains to this day. Following World War II, most of the French colonial empire became decolonized. Throughout its long history, France has been a leading global center of culture, making significant contributions to art, science, and philosophy. It hosts Europe's third-largest number of cultural UNESCO World Heritage Sites (after Italy and Spain) and receives around 83 million foreign tourists annually, the most of any country in the world. France remains a great power with significant cultural, economic, military, and political influence. It is a developed country with the world's sixth-largest economy by nominal GDP and ninth-largest by purchasing power parity. According to Credit Suisse, France is the fourth wealthiest nation in the world in terms of aggregate household wealth. It also possesses the world's largest exclusive economic zone (EEZ), covering 11,691,000 square kilometres (4,514,000 sq mi). French citizens enjoy a high standard of living, and the country performs well in international rankings of education, health care, life expectancy, civil liberties, and human development. France is a founding member of the United Nations, where it serves as one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. It is a member of the Group of 7, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Trade Organization (WTO), and La Francophonie.

"""Lost for Words"" is a song recorded by English rock band Pink Floyd, written by guitarist and lead singer David Gilmour and his spouse Polly Samson for the band's fourteenth studio album, The Division Bell. It appears as the penultimate track on the album.

"David Tecchler, sometimes also written Techler, Tekler, Deckler, Dechler, Decler, Teccler or Teckler, (1666–1748) was a German luthier, best known for his cellos and double basses. Tecchler was born in Augsburg, Germany and moved to Rome, Italy as he was still quite young and where he established. His instruments are Germanic or Italian in their style of construction. Possibly the most famous Tecchler cello known today is the ""ex Roser"" of Rome 1723, currently being played by soloist Robert Cohen. The scroll of the ""ex Roser"" is a sculpted portrait of its commissioner, David Tecchler's employer in Rome, who resided in the Vatican. A 1706 Tecchler cello was acquired by the Canada Council for the Arts Musical Instrument Bank and is on loan to the Canadian cellist Denis Brott. Other musicians who own or play Tecchler instruments include Anne Martindale Williams, principal cellist of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, who plays a Tecchler cello made in Rome in 1701; the young Turkish cellist Benyamin Sönmez, who plays a cello made in Rome in 1723; Martha Babcock, Assistant Principal cello at the Boston Symphony Orchestra and Principal cello for the Boston Pops owns a Tecchler known as the “ex-Feuermann”, made in Rome in 1741; the Danish cellist Jakob Kullberg, known for his collaborations with the composer Per Nørgaard, plays a Tecchler cello made in 1703 in Rome; the Israeli cellist Yehuda Hanani performs on a 1730 Tecchler of particular beauty, tonally and visually, previously in the possession of the Von Mendelssohn family; Marcy Rosen, soloist and member of the Mendelssohn String Quartet, plays an exceptionally beautiful Tecchler cello dated 1720. Her cello, owned by the famous Francais family of Luthiers for three generations, was shown in Jacques Francais’s Lincoln Center Stainer exhibition in the 1980s. Steven Doane, Professor of Cello at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, USA, plays a David Tecchler cello dated 1720. Professor Anthony Elliott at the University of Michigan owns a particularly beautiful Tecchler once owned by the Duke of Edinburgh. Latvian Soloist Maxim Beitan plays a David Tecchler Cello dated 1698. Ray Shows, founding member of the Artaria String Quartet (Boston 1986), professor at St. Olaf College and 2004 prizewinner of a McKnight Fellowship plays a violin by David Tecchler from 1726.

These stars are of particular interest in the search for extraterrestrial life because they are stable on the main sequence for a very long time (15 to 30 billion years, compared to 10 billion for the Sun). This may create an opportunity for life to evolve on terrestrial planets orbiting such stars. K-type stars also emit less ultraviolet radiation (which can damage DNA and thus hamper the emergence of life) than G-type stars like the Sun.

"Canada (/ˈkænədə/; French: [ka.na.da]) is a country in the northern part of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering 9.98 million square kilometres (3.85 million square miles), making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains; about four-fifths of the country's population of 35 million people live near the southern border. The majority of Canada has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. The land now called Canada has been inhabited for millennia by various Aboriginal peoples. Beginning in the 15th century, British and French colonies were established on the Atlantic coast, with the first establishment of a region called ""Canada"" occurring in 1537. As a consequence of various conflicts, the United Kingdom gained and lost territories within British North America until left, in the late 18th century, with what mostly geographically comprises Canada today. Pursuant to the British North America Act, on July 1, 1867, the colonies of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia joined to form the autonomous federal Dominion of Canada. This began an accretion of provinces and territories to the self-governing Dominion to the present ten provinces and three territories forming modern Canada. In 1931, Canada achieved near total independence from the United Kingdom with the Statute of Westminster 1931, and full sovereignty was attained when the Canada Act 1982 removed the last remaining ties of legal dependence on the British parliament. Canada is a federal parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy, with Queen Elizabeth II being the head of state. The country is officially bilingual at federal level. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries. Its advanced economy is the eleventh largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its economy and culture. Canada is a developed country and has the tenth highest nominal per capita income globally, and the ninth highest ranking in the Human Development Index. It ranks among the highest in international measurements of government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, economic freedom, and education. Canada is a Commonwealth Realm member of the Commonwealth of Nations, a member of the Francophonie, and part of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the G8, the Group of Ten, the G20, the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.","[('Canada', 'United States', 'border', 'P47'), ('Canada', 'United States', 'border', 'P47'), ('United States', 'Canada', 'border', 'P47'), ('United States', 'Canada', 'border', 'P47'), ('United Kingdom', 'Westminster', 'parliament', 'P194'), ('United Kingdom', 'British parliament', 'parliament', 'P194'), ('Canada', 'Commonwealth Realm', 'is a', 'P31'), ('Canada', 'Commonwealth', 'member of', 'P463'), ('Canada', 'Commonwealth', 'member of', 'P463'), ('Canada', 'Francophonie', 'member of', 'P463'), ('Canada', 'Francophonie', 'member of', 'P463'), ('Canada', 'North Atlantic Treaty Organization', 'member of', 'P463'), ('Canada', 'North Atlantic Treaty Organization', 'member of', 'P463'), ('Canada', 'G20', 'member of', 'P463'), ('Canada', 'G20', 'member of', 'P463'), ('Canada', 'North American Free Trade Agreement', 'member of', 'P463'), ('Canada', 'North American Free Trade Agreement', 'member of', 'P463'), ('Canada', 'Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation', 'member of', 'P463'), ('Canada', 'Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation', 'member of', 'P463'), ('Commonwealth Realm', 'Commonwealth', 'part of', 'P361'), ('Commonwealth', 'intergovernmental', 'is a', 'P31'), ('Francophonie', 'intergovernmental', 'is a', 'P31'), ('North Atlantic Treaty Organization', 'intergovernmental', 'is a', 'P31'), ('G20', 'Canada', 'member', 'P527'), ('G20', 'Canada', 'member', 'P527'), ('G20', 'intergovernmental', 'is a', 'P31')]","['Canada (/ˈkænədə/; French: [ka.na.da]) is a country in the northern part of North America.', ""Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering 9.98 million square kilometres (3.85 million square miles), making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area."", ""Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border."", ""Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains; about four-fifths of the country's population of 35 million people live near the southern border."", 'The majority of Canada has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer.', 'The land now called Canada has been inhabited for millennia by various Aboriginal peoples.', 'Beginning in the 15th century, British and French colonies were established on the Atlantic coast, with the first establishment of a region called ""Canada"" occurring in 1537.', 'As a consequence of various conflicts, the United Kingdom gained and lost territories within British North America until left, in the late 18th century, with what mostly geographically comprises Canada today.', 'Pursuant to the British North America Act, on July 1, 1867, the colonies of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia joined to form the autonomous federal Dominion of Canada.', 'This began an accretion of provinces and territories to the self-governing Dominion to the present ten provinces and three territories forming modern Canada.', 'In 1931, Canada achieved near total independence from the United Kingdom with the Statute of Westminster 1931, and full sovereignty was attained when the Canada Act 1982 removed the last remaining ties of legal dependence on the British parliament.', 'Canada is a federal parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy, with Queen Elizabeth II being the head of state.', 'The country is officially bilingual at federal level.', ""It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries."", 'Its advanced economy is the eleventh largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks.', ""Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its economy and culture."", 'Canada is a developed country and has the tenth highest nominal per capita income globally, and the ninth highest ranking in the Human Development Index.', 'It ranks among the highest in international measurements of government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, economic freedom, and education.', 'Canada is a Commonwealth Realm member of the Commonwealth of Nations, a member of the Francophonie, and part of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the G8, the Group of Ten, the G20, the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.']",19,361,53
"Lindy Rodwell (born 13 February 1962 in Johannesburg) is a South African zoologist and conservationist who dedicated herself to ensuring viable wetland habitat and population sizes for the cranes of Africa south of the Sahara, namely the endangered blue crane and grey-crowned crane and the critically endangered wattled crane. Lindy Rodwell was awarded a BSc(Zoology) and a Higher Diploma in Education from the University of Cape Town. She served a five-month internship with the International Crane Foundation in Baraboo, Wisconsin, United States. Then, while working at a bird park in South Africa, she became aware that she could make a greater contribution to wildlife by becoming involved in local and global conservation politics.

However, beyond South Africa’s borders, wattled cranes range across ten countries: Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Malawi, Zambia, Tanzania, Angola, Ethiopia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

"Israel (/ˈɪzreɪəl/ or /ˈɪzriːəl/; Hebrew: יִשְׂרָאֵל Yisrā'el; Arabic: إِسْرَائِيل Isrāʼīl), officially the State of Israel (Hebrew: מְדִינַת יִשְׂרָאֵל Medīnat Yisrā'el [mediˈnat jisʁaˈʔel]; Arabic: دولة إِسْرَائِيل Dawlat Isrāʼīl [dawlat ʔisraːˈʔiːl]), is a sovereign state in Asia. The country is situated in the Middle East at the southeastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea and the northern shore of the Gulf of Aqaba in the Red Sea. It shares land borders with Lebanon to the north, Syria in the northeast, Jordan on the east, the Palestinian territories (which are claimed by the State of Palestine and are partially controlled by Israel) comprising the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the east and west, respectively, and Egypt to the southwest. It contains geographically diverse features within its relatively small area. Israel's financial and technology center is Tel Aviv, while Jerusalem is both its self-designated capital (unrecognised by the United Nations) and the most populous individual city under the country's governmental administration. Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem is internationally disputed. On 29 November 1947, the United Nations General Assembly recommended the adoption and implementation of the Partition Plan for Mandatory Palestine. This UN plan specified borders for new Arab and Jewish states and also specified an area of Jerusalem and its environs which was to be administered by the UN under an international regime. The end of the British Mandate for Palestine was set for midnight on 14 May 1948. That day, David Ben-Gurion, the Executive Head of the Zionist Organization and president of the Jewish Agency for Palestine, declared ""the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz Israel, to be known as the State of Israel,"" which would start to function from the termination of the mandate. The borders of the new state were not specified in the declaration. Neighboring Arab armies invaded the former Palestinian mandate on the next day and fought the Israeli forces. Israel has since fought several wars with neighboring Arab states, in the course of which it has occupied the West Bank, Sinai Peninsula (1956–57, 1967–82), part of South Lebanon (1982–2000), Gaza Strip (1967-2005; still considered occupied after 2005 disengagement) and the Golan Heights. It extended its laws to the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem, but not the West Bank. Efforts to resolve the Israeli–Palestinian conflict have not resulted in peace. However, peace treaties between Israel and both Egypt and Jordan have successfully been signed. Israel’s occupation of Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem is the world's longest military occupation in modern times. The population of Israel, as defined by the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, was estimated in 2014 to be 8,146,300 people. It is the world's only Jewish-majority state, with 6,212,000 citizens, or 74.9% of Israelis, being designated as Jewish. The country's second largest group of citizens are denoted as Arabs, numbering 1,718,400 people (including the Druze and most East Jerusalem Arabs). The great majority of Israeli Arabs are settled Sunni Muslims, with smaller but significant numbers of semi-settled Negev Bedouins; the rest are Christians and Druze. Other far smaller minorities include Maronites, Samaritans, Dom people and Roma, Black Hebrew Israelites, other Sub-Saharan Africans, Armenians, Circassians, Vietnamese boat people, and others. Israel also hosts a significant population of non-citizen foreign workers and asylum seekers from Africa and Asia. In its Basic Laws, Israel defines itself as a Jewish and Democratic State. Israel is a representative democracy with a parliamentary system, proportional representation and universal suffrage. The Prime Minister serves as head of government and the Knesset serves as the legislative body. Israel is a developed country and an OECD member, with the 37th-largest economy in the world by nominal gross domestic product as of 2014. The country benefits from a highly skilled workforce and is among the most educated countries in the world with the one of the highest percentage of its citizens holding a tertiary education degree. The country has the highest standard of living in the Middle East and the fourth highest in Asia, and has one of the highest life expectancies in the world.","[('Lebanon', 'Syria', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Lebanon', 'Israel', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Lebanon', 'It', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Syria', 'Lebanon', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Syria', 'Jordan', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Syria', 'Israel', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Syria', 'It', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Jordan', 'Syria', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Jordan', 'Israel', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Jordan', 'It', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Palestine', 'Palestinian territories', 'land', 'P17'), ('Israel', 'Lebanon', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Israel', 'Syria', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Israel', 'Jordan', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Israel', 'Palestinian territories', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Israel', 'West Bank', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Israel', 'Gaza Strip', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Israel', 'Egypt', 'borders', 'P47'), ('West Bank', 'Palestinian territories', 'land', 'P17'), ('West Bank', 'Israel', 'borders', 'P47'), ('West Bank', 'Israel', 'land', 'P17'), ('West Bank', 'It', 'borders', 'P47'), ('West Bank', 'It', 'land', 'P17'), ('Gaza Strip', 'Palestinian territories', 'land', 'P17'), ('Gaza Strip', 'Israel', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Gaza Strip', 'Egypt', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Gaza Strip', 'It', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Egypt', 'Israel', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Egypt', 'Gaza Strip', 'borders', 'P47'), ('Egypt', 'It', 'borders', 'P47'), ('It', 'Lebanon', 'borders', 'P47'), ('It', 'Syria', 'borders', 'P47'), ('It', 'Jordan', 'borders', 'P47'), ('It', 'Palestinian territories', 'borders', 'P47'), ('It', 'West Bank', 'borders', 'P47'), ('It', 'Gaza Strip', 'borders', 'P47'), ('It', 'Egypt', 'borders', 'P47')]","[""Israel (/ˈɪzreɪəl/ or /ˈɪzriːəl/;

Listed at 7 ft 1 in (2.16 m) tall and weighing 325 pounds (147 kg), he was one of the heaviest players ever to play in the NBA. O'Neal played for six teams throughout his 19-year NBA career. He was announced as a nominee for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on December 21, 2015. Following his career at Louisiana State University, O'Neal was drafted by the Orlando Magic with the first overall pick in the 1992 NBA draft. He quickly became one of the best centers in the league, winning Rookie of the Year in 1992–93 and later leading his team to the 1995 NBA Finals. After four years with the Magic, O'Neal signed as a free agent with the Los Angeles Lakers. They won three consecutive championships in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Amid tension between O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat in 2004, and his fourth NBA championship followed in 2006. Midway through the 2007–2008 season he was traded to the Phoenix Suns. After a season-and-a-half with the Suns, O'Neal was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2009–10 season. O'Neal played for the Boston Celtics in the 2010–11 season before retiring. O'Neal's individual accolades include the 1999–2000 MVP award, the 1992–93 NBA Rookie of the Year award, 15 All-Star game selections, three All-Star Game MVP awards, three Finals MVP awards, two scoring titles, 14 All-NBA team selections, and three NBA All-Defensive Team selections. He is one of only three players to win NBA MVP, All-Star game MVP and Finals MVP awards in the same year (2000); the other players are Willis Reed in 1970 and Michael Jordan in 1996 and 1998. He ranks 7th all-time in points scored, 5th in field goals, 13th in rebounds, and 7th in blocks. Largely due to his ability to dunk the basketball, O'Neal also ranks 3rd all-time in field goal percentage (58.2%).

"Polish cuisine is a style of cooking and food preparation originating in or widely popular in Poland. Polish cuisine has evolved over the centuries to become very eclectic due to Poland's history. Polish cuisine shares many similarities with other Slavic countries, especially Czech, Slovak, Belarusian, Ukrainian and Russian cuisines. It has also been widely influenced by other Central European cuisines, namely German, Austrian and Hungarian cuisines as well as Jewish, French, Turkish and Italian culinary traditions. It is rich in meat, especially pork, chicken and beef (depending on the region), winter vegetables (cabbage in the dish bigos), and herbs. It is also characteristic in its use of various kinds of noodles the most notable of which are kluski as well as cereals such as kasha (from the Polish word kasza). Generally speaking, Polish cuisine is hearty and uses a lot of cream and eggs. The traditional dishes are often demanding in preparation. Many Poles allow themselves a generous amount of time to serve and enjoy their festive meals, especially Christmas eve dinner (Wigilia) or Easter breakfast which could take a number of days to prepare in their entirety. The Polish national dishes are bigos [ˈbiɡɔs]; pierogi [pʲɛˈrɔɡʲi]; kiełbasa; kotlet schabowy [ˈkɔtlɛt sxaˈbɔvɨ] (type of breaded cutlet); gołąbki [ɡɔˈwɔ̃pkʲi] (type of cabbage roll); zrazy [ˈzrazɨ] (type of roulade); roast (Polish: pieczeń) [ˈpʲɛt͡ʂɛɲ]; sour cucumber soup (Polish: zupa ogórkowa) [ˈzupa ɔɡurˈkɔva]; mushroom soup, (Polish: zupa grzybowa) [ˈzupa ɡʐɨˈbɔva] (quite different from the North American cream of mushroom); tomato soup (Polish: zupa pomidorowa) [ˈzupa pɔmidɔˈrɔva]; rosół [ˈrɔsuw] (variety of meat broth); żurek [ˈʐurɛk] (sour rye soup); flaki [ˈflakʲi] (variety of tripe soup); and barszcz [barʂt͡ʂ] among others. The main meal might be eaten about 2 p.m. or later. It is larger than the North American lunch. It might be composed of three courses especially among the traditionalists, starting with a soup like a popular rosół and tomato soup or more festive barszcz (beet borscht) or żurek (sour rye meal mash), followed perhaps in a restaurant by an appetizer such as herring (prepared in either cream, oil, or in aspic); or other cured meats and vegetable salads. The main course usually includes a serving of meat, such as roast or kotlet schabowy (breaded pork cutlet), or chicken. Vegetables, currently replaced by leafy green salads, were not very long ago most commonly served as surówka [suˈrufka] – shredded root vegetables with lemon and sugar (carrot, celeriac, seared beetroot) or sauerkraut (Polish: kapusta kiszona) [kaˈpusta kʲiˈʂɔna]. The side dishes are usually boiled potatoes, rice or more traditionally kasza (cereals). Meals often conclude with a dessert such as makowiec, a poppy seed pastry, or drożdżówka [drɔʐˈd͡ʐufka], a type of yeast cake. Other Polish specialities include chłodnik [ˈxwɔdɲik] (a chilled beet or fruit soup for hot days), golonka (pork knuckles cooked with vegetables), kołduny (meat dumplings), zrazy (stuffed slices of beef), salceson and flaki (tripe).","[('kotlet schabowy', 'breaded cutlet', 'type of', 'P279'), ('kotlet schabowy', 'breaded cutlet', 'type of', 'P279'), ('kotlet schabowy', 'breaded cutlet', 'type of', 'P279'), ('cucumber soup', 'soup', 'type of', 'P279'), ('cucumber soup', 'soup', 'type of', 'P279'), ('cucumber soup', 'soup', 'type of', 'P279'), ('zupa ogórkowa', 'soup', 'type of', 'P279'), ('zupa ogórkowa', 'soup', 'type of', 'P279'), ('zupa ogórkowa', 'soup', 'type of', 'P279'), ('tomato soup', 'soup', 'type of', 'P279'), ('tomato soup', 'soup', 'type of', 'P279'), ('tomato soup', 'soup', 'type of', 'P279'), ('żurek', 'soup', 'type of', 'P279'), ('żurek', 'soup', 'type of', 'P279'), ('żurek', 'soup', 'type of', 'P279'), ('sour rye soup', 'soup', 'type of', 'P279'), ('sour rye soup', 'soup', 'type of', 'P279'), ('sour rye soup', 'soup', 'type of', 'P279'), ('tripe soup', 'soup', 'type of', 'P279'), ('tripe soup', 'soup', 'type of', 'P279'), ('tripe soup', 'soup', 'type of', 'P279'), ('barszcz', 'soup', 'type of', 'P279'), ('barszcz', 'soup', 'type of', 'P279'), ('barszcz', 'soup', 'type of', 'P279'), ('soup', 'vegetable', 'composed of', 'P527'), ('barszcz', 'beet', 'composed of', 'P527'), ('kotlet schabowy', 'pork', 'includes', 'P527'), ('makowiec', 'pastry', 'type of', 'P279'), ('chłodnik', 'beet', 'include', 'P527'), ('zrazy', 'beef', 'include', 'P527')]","['Polish cuisine is a style of cooking and food preparation originating in or widely popular in Poland.', ""Polish cuisine has evolved over the centuries to become very eclectic due to Poland's history."", 'Polish cuisine shares many similarities with other Slavic countries, especially Czech, Slovak, Belarusian, Ukrainian and Russian cuisines.', 'It has also been widely influenced by other Central European cuisines, namely German, Austrian and Hungarian cuisines as well as Jewish, French, Turkish and Italian culinary traditions.', 'It is rich in meat, especially pork, chicken and beef (depending on the region), winter vegetables (cabbage in the dish bigos), and herbs.', 'It is also characteristic in its use of various kinds of noodles the most notable of which are kluski as well as cereals such as kasha (from the Polish word kasza).', 'Generally speaking, Polish cuisine is hearty and uses a lot of cream and eggs.', 'The traditional dishes are often demanding in preparation.', 'Many Poles allow themselves a generous amount of time to serve and enjoy their festive meals, especially Christmas eve dinner (Wigilia) or Easter breakfast which could take a number of days to prepare in their entirety.', 'The Polish national dishes are bigos [ˈbiɡɔs]; pierogi [pʲɛˈrɔɡʲi]; kiełbasa; kotlet schabowy [ˈkɔtlɛt sxaˈbɔvɨ] (type of breaded cutlet); gołąbki [ɡɔˈwɔ̃pkʲi] (type of cabbage roll); zrazy [ˈzrazɨ] (type of roulade); roast (Polish: pieczeń) [ˈpʲɛt͡ʂɛɲ]; sour cucumber soup (Polish: zupa ogórkowa) [ˈzupa ɔɡurˈkɔva]; mushroom soup, (Polish: zupa grzybowa) [ˈzupa ɡʐɨˈbɔva] (quite different from the North American cream of mushroom); tomato soup (Polish: zupa pomidorowa) [ˈzupa pɔmidɔˈrɔva]; rosół [ˈrɔsuw] (variety of meat broth); żurek [ˈʐurɛk] (sour rye soup); flaki [ˈflakʲi] (variety of tripe soup); and barszcz [barʂt͡ʂ] among others.', 'The main meal might be eaten about 2 p.m. or later.', 'It is larger than the North American lunch.', 'It might be composed of three courses especially among the traditionalists, starting with a soup like a popular rosół and tomato soup or more festive barszcz (beet borscht) or żurek (sour rye meal mash), followed perhaps in a restaurant by an appetizer such as herring (prepared in either cream, oil, or in aspic); or other cured meats and vegetable salads.', 'The main course usually includes a serving of meat, such as roast or kotlet schabowy (breaded pork cutlet), or chicken.', 'Vegetables, currently replaced by leafy green salads, were not very long ago most commonly served as surówka [suˈrufka] – shredded root vegetables with lemon and sugar (carrot, celeriac, seared beetroot) or sauerkraut (Polish: kapusta kiszona) [kaˈpusta kʲiˈʂɔna].', 'The side dishes are usually boiled potatoes, rice or more traditionally kasza (cereals).', 'Meals often conclude with a dessert such as makowiec, a poppy seed pastry, or drożdżówka [drɔʐˈd͡ʐufka], a type of yeast cake.', 'Other Polish specialities include chłodnik [ˈxwɔdɲik] (a chilled beet or fruit soup for hot days), golonka (pork knuckles cooked with vegetables), kołduny (meat dumplings), zrazy (stuffed slices of beef), salceson and flaki (tripe).']",18,641,86
"Bolivia is a country in South America, bordered by Brazil to the north and east, Paraguay and Argentina to the south, Chile to the west, and Peru to the west. It has a Native American population which has mixed Spanish cultural elements with their ancestors' traditions. The Spanish-speaking population mainly follows Western customs. The cultural development of what is now Bolivia is divided into three distinct periods: pre-Columbian, colonial, and republican. Important archaeological ruins, gold and silver ornaments, stone monuments, ceramics, and weavings remain from several important pre-Columbian cultures. Major ruins include Tiwanaku, Samaipata, Inkallaqta and Iskanwaya. The country abounds in other sites that are difficult to reach and hardly explored by archaeologists. The Spanish brought their own tradition of religious art which, in the hands of local indigenous and mestizo builders and artisans, developed into a rich and distinctive style of architecture, literature, and sculpture known as ""Mestizo Baroque."" The colonial period produced not only the paintings of Perez de Holguin, Flores, Bitti, and others, but also the works of skilled but unknown stonecutters, woodcarvers, goldsmiths, and silversmiths. An important body of native baroque religious music of the colonial period was recovered in recent years and has been performed internationally to wide acclaim since 1994.

"The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to Ethiopia: Ethiopia – landlocked sovereign country located in the Horn of Africa. Ethiopia is bordered by Eritrea to the north, Sudan to the west, South Sudan to the south-west, Kenya to the south, Somalia to the east and Djibouti to the north-east. Ethiopia is one of the oldest countries in the world and Africa's second-most populous nation. Ethiopia has yielded some of humanity's oldest traces, making the area important in the history of human evolution. Recent studies claim that the vicinity of present-day Addis Ababa was the point from which human beings migrated around the world. Ethiopian dynastic history traditionally began with the reign of Emperor Menelik I in 1000 BC. The roots of the Ethiopian state are similarly deep, dating with unbroken continuity to at least the Aksumite Empire (which adopted the name ""Ethiopia"" in the 4th century) and its predecessor state, D`mt (with early 1st millennium BC roots). After a period of decentralized power in the 18th and early 19th centuries known as the Zemene Mesafint (""Era of the Judges/Princes""), the country was reunited in 1855 by Kassa Hailu, who became Emperor Tewodros II, beginning Ethiopia's modern history. Ethiopia's borders underwent significant territorial expansion to its modern borders for the rest of the century, especially by Emperor Menelik II and Ras Gobena, culminating in its victory over the Italians at the Battle of Adwa in 1896 with the military leadership of Ras Makonnen, and ensuring its sovereignty and freedom from colonization.

"The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to Serbia: Serbia – landlocked sovereign country located in Southeastern Europe and comprising the southern portion of the Pannonian Plain and a central portion of the Balkan Peninsula.

The capital of Serbia is Belgrade. For centuries, shaped at cultural boundaries between East and West, a powerful medieval kingdom – later renamed the Serbian Empire – occupied much of the Balkans. Torn by domestic feuds, Ottoman, Hungarian, and later, Austrian incursions, the Serbian state collapsed by the mid-16th century. The positive outcome of the Serbian revolution in 1817 marked the birth of modern Serbia. Within a century it reacquired Kosovo, Raška and Vardar Macedonia from the Ottoman Empire. Likewise, in 1918 the former autonomous Habsburg crownland of Vojvodina proclaimed its secession from Austria-Hungary to unite with Serbia, preceded by the Syrmia region. The current borders of the country were established following the end of World War II, when Serbia became a federal unit within the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.Serbia became an independent state again in 2006, after Montenegro left the union that formed after the dissolution of Yugoslavia in 1990s. In February 2008, the parliament of Kosovo unilaterally declared independence from Serbia. Serbia's government, as well as the UN Security Council, have not recognized Kosovo's independence.

"The Gaza–Israel conflict is a part of the wider Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Palestinian militant actions escalated in the Gaza Strip following the overwhelming election to government of the Islamist political party Hamas in 2005 and 2006. The conflict escalated with the split of the Palestinian Authority into the Fatah government in the West Bank and the Hamas government in Gaza and the following violent ousting of Fatah after Fatah lost the election to Hamas. Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel and the joint Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza have exacerbated the conflict. The international community considers indiscriminate attacks on civilians and civilian structures that do not discriminate between civilians and military targets illegal under international law. As part of its 2005 disengagement plan, Israel retained exclusive control over Gaza's airspace and territorial waters, continued to patrol and monitor the external land perimeter of the Gaza Strip, with the exception of its southernmost border (where Egypt retained control of the border and border crossings were supervised by European monitors) and continued to monitor and blockade Gaza's coastline. Israel largely provides and controls Gaza's water supply, electricity and communications infrastructure. According to Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, Israel remains an occupying power under international law. The United Nations has stated that under resolutions of both the General Assembly and the Security Council, it regards Gaza to be part of the ""Occupied Palestinian Territories"".

"Lega Nord Trieste (English: Northern League Trieste) was a regionalist political party in Italy.

The longstanding leader of the party was Fabrizio Belloni, a keen independentist, who later left Lega Nord and became a harsh critic of Umberto Bossi. The main reasons for having a separate party from Lega Nord Friuli was that Trieste, capital city of Friuli-Venezia Giulia, had a very different history from Friuli (see Free Territory of Trieste) and that Trieste's culture is slightly different from that of Friuli, as the spoken language in Trieste is not Friulian, which is spoken essentially in the Province of Udine, but Venetian, which is however spoken also in parts of the Province of Gorizia and the Province of Pordenone. The party was never strong as its counterpart Lega Nord Friuli and obtained its best results from 1992 to 1996, when it gained 7-8% in the Province.

"The border between the Southeast Asian countries of Indonesia and Malaysia consist of both a land border separating the two countries' territories on the island of Borneo as well as maritime boundaries along the length of the Straits of Malacca, in the South China Sea and in the Celebes Sea. The land boundary has a length of 2,019.5 km and stretches from Tanjung Datu at the northwestern corner of Borneo, through the highlands of the Borneo hinterland, to the Gulf of Sebatik and the Celebes Sea in the eastern side of the island. The boundary separates the Indonesian provinces of North Kalimantan, East Kalimantan and West Kalimantan, and the Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak. The maritime boundary in the Straits of Malacca generally follows the median line between the baselines of Indonesia and Malaysian, running south from the tripoint with Thailand to the start of the maritime border with Singapore. Only part of this boundary has been delimited through a continental shelf boundary treaty in 1969 and a territorial sea boundary treaty in 1970. The continental shelf boundary between Indonesia and Malaysia in the South China Sea is also drawn along the equidistant line between the baselines of the two countries under the 1969 continental shelf boundary. The border in the Celebes Sea is subject to dispute between the two countries. Part of the dispute was settled by the judgement of the International Court of Justice in the Ligitan and Sipadan Case in 2002 and is now awaiting delimitation between the two countries.

"Socrates on Trial is a play depicting the life and death of the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates. It tells the story of how Socrates was put on trial for corrupting the youth of Athens and for failing to honour the city’s gods. The play contains adaptations of several classic Greek works: the slapstick comedy, Clouds, written by Aristophanes and first performed in 423 BCE; the dramatic monologue, Apology, written by Plato to record the defence speech Socrates gave at his trial; and Plato’s Crito and Phaedo, two dialogues describing the events leading to Socrates’ execution in 399 BCE. The play was written by Andrew David Irvine of the University of British Columbia and premiered by director Joan Bryans of Vital Spark Theatre Company in 2007 at the Chan Centre for the Performing Arts in Vancouver. In the judgment of one reviewer, the play succeeds in presenting Socrates both as Plato's wise mentor and as the “pompous, arrogant and often petulant” individual presented by Aristophanes, giving modern audiences a greater appreciation of why Socrates eventually ended up being sentenced to death.","[('Plato', 'Socrates', 'works', 'P800'), ('Plato', 'Crito', 'works', 'P800'), ('Plato', 'Phaedo', 'works', 'P800'), ('Plato', 'Socrates', 'works', 'P800'), ('Socrates', 'Plato', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Socrates', 'Plato', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Socrates', 'Plato', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Socrates', 'Plato', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Plato', 'Socrates', 'works', 'P800'), ('Plato', 'Crito', 'works', 'P800'), ('Plato', 'Phaedo', 'works', 'P800'), ('Plato', 'Socrates', 'works', 'P800'), ('Crito', 'Plato', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Crito', 'Plato', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Crito', 'Plato', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Crito', 'Plato', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Phaedo', 'Plato', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Phaedo', 'Plato', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Phaedo', 'Plato', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Phaedo', 'Plato', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Socrates', 'Plato', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Socrates', 'Plato', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Socrates', 'Plato', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Socrates', 'Plato', 'written by', 'P50'), ('Plato', 'Socrates', 'mentor', 'P1066'), ('Plato', 'Socrates', 'mentor', 'P1066')]","['Socrates on Trial is a play depicting the life and death of the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates.', 'It tells the story of how Socrates was put on trial for corrupting the youth of Athens and for failing to honour the city’s gods.', 'The play contains adaptations of several classic Greek works: the slapstick comedy, Clouds, written by Aristophanes and first performed in 423 BCE; the dramatic monologue, Apology, written by Plato to record the defence speech Socrates gave at his trial; and Plato’s Crito and Phaedo, two dialogues describing the events leading to Socrates’ execution in 399 BCE.', 'The play was written by Andrew David Irvine of the University of British Columbia and premiered by director Joan Bryans of Vital Spark Theatre Company in 2007 at the Chan Centre for the Performing Arts in Vancouver.', ""In the judgment of one reviewer, the play succeeds in presenting Socrates both as Plato's wise mentor and as the “pompous, arrogant and often petulant” individual presented by Aristophanes, giving modern audiences a greater appreciation of why Socrates eventually ended up being sentenced to death.""]",5,363,56

The geomorphological term Pannonian Plain is more widely used for roughly the same region though with a somewhat different sense - meaning only the lowlands, the plain that remained when the Pliocene Epoch Pannonian Sea dried out. It is a geomorphological subsystem of the Alps-Himalaya system. Most of the plain consists of the Great Hungarian Plain (in the south and east, including the Eastern Slovak Lowland) and the Little Hungarian Plain (in the northwest), divided by the Transdanubian Mountains. The Pannonian Basin lies in the southeastern part of Central Europe, or at the boundary between Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe (Balkans).It forms a topographically discrete unit set in the European landscape, surrounded by imposing geographic boundaries - the Carpathian Mountains, the Alps, the Dinarides and the Balkan mountains. The Rivers Danube and Tisza divide the basin roughly in half. It extends roughly between Vienna in the northwest, Zagreb in the southwest, Belgrade in the southeast and Satu Mare in the northeast. In terms of modern state boundaries, the basin centres on the territory of Hungary, but it also extends to Northern Serbia, Central Croatia and Slavonia, western Slovakia, the Eastern Slovak Lowland (including the southwestern tip of Ukraine), besides the border regions of northern Bosnia and Herzegovina, some western portions of Romania, and the eastern extremities of Slovenia and of Austria. The name ""Pannonian"" comes from Pannonia, a province of the Roman Empire. Only the western part of the territory of modern Hungary (the so-called Transdanubia) formed part of the ancient Roman Province of Pannonia; this comprises less than 29% of modern Hungary, therefore Hungarian geographers avoid the terms ""Pannonian Basin"" and ""Pannonian Plain"".","[('Hungary', 'Serbia', 'border', 'P47'), ('Hungary', 'Slovakia', 'border', 'P47'), ('Hungary', 'Ukraine', 'border', 'P47'), ('Hungary', 'Romania', 'border', 'P47'), ('Hungary', 'Slovenia', 'border', 'P47'), ('Hungary', 'Austria', 'border', 'P47'), ('Serbia', 'Hungary', 'border', 'P47'), ('Serbia', 'Bosnia', 'border', 'P47'), ('Serbia', 'Romania', 'border', 'P47'), ('Slovakia', 'Hungary', 'border', 'P47'), ('Slovakia', 'Ukraine', 'border', 'P47'), ('Slovakia', 'Austria', 'border', 'P47'), ('Eastern Slovak Lowland', 'Slovakia', 'state', 'P17'), ('Ukraine', 'Hungary', 'border', 'P47'), ('Ukraine', 'Slovakia', 'border', 'P47'), ('Ukraine', 'Romania', 'border', 'P47'), ('Bosnia', 'Serbia', 'border', 'P47'), ('Herzegovina', 'Bosnia', 'state', 'P17'), ('Romania', 'Hungary', 'border', 'P47'), ('Romania', 'Serbia', 'border', 'P47'), ('Romania', 'Ukraine', 'border', 'P47'), ('Slovenia', 'Hungary', 'border', 'P47'), ('Slovenia', 'Austria', 'border', 'P47'), ('Austria', 'Hungary', 'border', 'P47'), ('Austria', 'Slovakia', 'border', 'P47'), ('Austria', 'Slovenia', 'border', 'P47')]","['The Pannonian Basin or Carpathian Basinis a large basin in East-Central Europe.', 'The geomorphological term Pannonian Plain is more widely used for roughly the same region though with a somewhat different sense - meaning only the lowlands, the plain that remained when the Pliocene Epoch Pannonian Sea dried out.', 'It is a geomorphological subsystem of the Alps-Himalaya system.', 'Most of the plain consists of the Great Hungarian Plain (in the south and east, including the Eastern Slovak Lowland) and the Little Hungarian Plain (in the northwest), divided by the Transdanubian Mountains.', 'The Pannonian Basin lies in the southeastern part of Central Europe, or at the boundary between Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe (Balkans).It forms a topographically discrete unit set in the European landscape, surrounded by imposing geographic boundaries - the Carpathian Mountains, the Alps, the Dinarides and the Balkan mountains.', 'The Rivers Danube and Tisza divide the basin roughly in half.', 'It extends roughly between Vienna in the northwest, Zagreb in the southwest, Belgrade in the southeast and Satu Mare in the northeast.', 'In terms of modern state boundaries, the basin centres on the territory of Hungary, but it also extends to Northern Serbia, Central Croatia and Slavonia, western Slovakia, the Eastern Slovak Lowland (including the southwestern tip of Ukraine), besides the border regions of northern Bosnia and Herzegovina, some western portions of Romania, and the eastern extremities of Slovenia and of Austria.', 'The name ""Pannonian"" comes from Pannonia, a province of the Roman Empire.', 'Only the western part of the territory of modern Hungary (the so-called Transdanubia) formed part of the ancient Roman Province of Pannonia; this comprises less than 29% of modern Hungary, therefore Hungarian geographers avoid the terms ""Pannonian Basin"" and ""Pannonian Plain"".']",10,396,60
"Cool Hand Luke is a 1967 American prison drama film directed by Stuart Rosenberg, starring Paul Newman and featuring George Kennedy in an Oscar-winning performance. Newman stars in the title role as Luke, a prisoner in a Florida prison camp who refuses to submit to the system. The film, set in the early 1950s, is based on Donn Pearce's 1965 novel of the same name. Pearce sold the story to Warner Bros., who then hired him to write the script. Due to Pearce's lack of film experience, the studio added Frank Pierson to rework the screenplay. Newman's biographer Marie Edelman Borden states that the ""tough, honest"" script drew together threads from earlier movies, especially Hombre, Newman's earlier film of 1967. The film has been cited by Roger Ebert as an anti-establishment film which was shot during the time of the Vietnam War, in which Newman's character endures ""physical punishment, psychological cruelty, hopelessness and equal parts of sadism and masochism"". His influence on his prison mates and the torture that he endures is compared to that of Jesus, and Christian symbolism is used throughout the film, culminating in a photograph superimposed over crossroads at the end of the film in comparison to the crucifixion. Filming took place on the San Joaquin River Delta, and the set, imitating a southern prison farm, was built in Stockton, California. The filmmakers sent a crew to Tavares Road Prison in Tavares, Florida, to take photographs and measurements. Upon its release, Cool Hand Luke received favorable reviews and became a box-office success. The film cemented Newman's status as one of the era's top box-office actors, while the film was described as the ""touchstone of an era"". Newman was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, George Kennedy won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, Pearce and Pierson were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, and the score by Lalo Schifrin was also nominated for the Best Original Score. In 2005, the United States Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry, considering it to be ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"". It has a rare 100% rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes. The quotation used by the prison warden in the film, which begins with ""What we've got here is failure to communicate"", was listed at No. 11 on the American Film Institute's list of the 100 most memorable movie lines.","[('Cool Hand Luke', 'Stuart Rosenberg', 'directed by', 'P57'), ('Cool Hand Luke', 'Paul Newman', 'starring', 'P161'), ('Cool Hand Luke', 'George Kennedy', 'starring', 'P161'),

It is the capital city of the Brest voblast. The city of Brest is a historic site of many cultures.

After World War I, the city again returned to sovereign Poland. During World War II the city was first taken by the Soviets and in 1941 by the Nazis. After the war, with the new boundaries of the Soviet Union with Poland, the city became part of the Soviet BSSR until the breakup of the country in 1991, placing the city in the custody of Belarus, where it remains today.","[('Brest', 'Belarusian', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brest', 'Belarusian', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brest', 'Belarusian', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brest', 'Belarusian', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brest', 'Belarus', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brest', 'Belarus', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brest', 'Belarusian', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brest', 'Belarusian', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brest', 'Belarusian', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brest', 'Belarusian', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brest', 'Belarus', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brest', 'Belarus', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brest', 'Belarusian', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brest', 'Belarusian', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brest', 'Belarusian', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brest', 'Belarusian', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brest', 'Belarus', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brest', 'Belarus', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brześć', 'Brest', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brześć', 'Brest', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brześć', 'Brest', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brześć', 'Brest', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brześć', 'Brest', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brześć', 'Brest', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brześć', 'Brest', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brześć', 'Brest', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brest', 'Belarusian', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brest', 'Belarusian', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brest', 'Belarusian', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brest', 'Belarusian', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brest', 'Belarus', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brest', 'Belarus', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brest-on-the-Bug', 'Brest', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brest-on-the-Bug', 'Brest', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brest-on-the-Bug', 'Brest', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brest-on-the-Bug', 'Brest', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brest-on-the-Bug', 'Brest', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brest-on-the-Bug', 'Brest', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brest-on-the-Bug', 'Brest', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brest-on-the-Bug', 'Brest', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brest-Litovsk', 'Brześć', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brest-Litovsk', 'Brześć', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brest-Litovsk', 'Brest-on-the-Bug', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brest-Litovsk', 'Brest-on-the-Bug', 'city', 'P131'), ('Brest voblast', 'It', 'capital city', 'P36'), ('Brest voblast', 'It', 'capital', 'P36'), ('It', 'Brest voblast', 'city', 'P131'), ('BSSR', 'Soviet Union', 'part of', 'P361'), ('BSSR', 'Soviet Union', 'country', 'P17'), ('BSSR', 'Soviet Union', 'city', 'P131'), ('BSSR', 'Soviet Union', 'city', 'P131'), ('BSSR', 'Soviet', 'part of', 'P361'), ('BSSR', 'Soviet', 'country', 'P17'), ('BSSR', 'Soviet', 'city', 'P131'), ('BSSR', 'Soviet', 'city', 'P131')]","['Brest (Belarusian: Брэст Brest Берасце, Bieraście; Russian: Брест Brest; Polish: Brześć; Ukrainian: Брест Brest, Берестя Berestia; Yiddish: בריסק Brisk), formerly also Brest-on-the-Bug and Brest-Litovsk (""Брэст-Лiтоўск"" in Belarusian), is a city (population 310,800 in 2010) in Belarus at the border with Poland opposite the Polish city of Terespol, where the Bug River and Mukhavets rivers meet.', 'It is the capital city of the Brest voblast.', 'The city of Brest is a historic site of many cultures.', 'Here were concluded such important historical documents as the Union of Brest and Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.', 'The city fortress was recognized by the Soviet Union as the Hero Fortress, a unique award.', 'The city, during medieval times, was part of the Kingdom of Poland from the tenth century until 1319 when it was taken by Grand Duchy of Lithuania until the Polish Partitions, when it became part of the Russian Empire in 1795.', 'After World War I, the city again returned to sovereign Poland.', 'During World War II the city was first taken by the Soviets and in 1941 by the Nazis.', 'After the war, with the new boundaries of the Soviet Union with Poland, the city became part of the Soviet BSSR until the breakup of the country in 1991, placing the city in the custody of Belarus, where it remains today.']",9,396,55
"The Tumen River, also called the Tuman River ([tumanɡaŋ]; called the Duman in South Korea), is a 521-kilometre (324 mi) long river that serves as part of the boundary between China, North Korea and Russia, rising on the slopes of Mount Paektu and flowing into the Sea of Japan. The river flows in northeast Asia, on the border between China and North Korea in its upper reaches, and between North Korea and Russia in its last 17 kilometers (11 mi) before entering the Sea of Japan. The river forms much of the southern border of Jilin Province in Northeast China and the northern borders of North Korea's North Hamgyong and Ryanggang provinces. Baekdu Mountain on the Chinese-North Korean border is the source of the river, as well as of the Yalu River (which forms the western portion of the border of North Korea and China). The name of the river comes from the Mongolian word tümen, meaning ""ten thousand"" or a myriad. This river is badly polluted by the nearby factories of North Korea and China; however, it still remains a major tourist attraction in the area. In Tumen, Jilin, China, a riverfront promenade has restaurants where patrons can gaze across the river into North Korea. The Russian name of the river is Tumannaya, literally meaning foggy. In 1938 the Japanese built the Tumen River Bridge, where the Quan River meets the Tumen River, between the villages of Wonjong (Hunchun) and Quanhe. Important cities and towns on the river are Hoeryong and Onsong in North Korea, Tumen and Nanping (Nanpingzhen, 南坪镇, in Helong County-level city) in China.

"The Region of Murcia (/ˈriːdʒən əv ˈmʊərsiə/; Spanish: Región de Murcia [reˈxjon de ˈmuɾθja]) is an autonomous community of Spain located in the southeast of the state, between Andalusia and Valencian Community, on the Mediterranean coast. The autonomous community consists of a single province, unlike most autonomous communities, which have several provinces within the same territory. Because of this, the autonomous community and the province are operated as one unit of government. The city of Murcia is the capital of the region and seat of government organs, except for the parliament, the Regional Assembly of Murcia, which is located in Cartagena. The autonomous community and province is subdivided into municipalities. The Region of Murcia is bordered by Andalusia (the provinces of Almería and Granada); Castile–La Mancha (the province of Albacete, which was historically connected to Murcia until 1980); the Valencian Community (province of Alicante); and the Mediterranean Sea. The community measures 11,313 km² and has a population of 1.4 million, of whom one-third live in the capital. The highest mountain is Los Obispos (2,015 m). The region is a major producer of fruits, vegetables, and flowers for the rest of Spain and Europe.

"The Karakoram, or Karakorum is a large mountain range spanning the borders between Pakistan, India and China, located in the regions of Gilgit–Baltistan (Pakistan), Ladakh (India), and southern Xinjiang (China).

"The State of Mexico (Spanish: Estado de México, [esˈtaðo ðe ˈmexiko]) is one of the 32 federal entities of Mexico. It is the most populous, as well as the most densely populated state. It is divided into 125 municipalities and its capital city is Toluca de Lerdo. The State of Mexico is often abbreviated to ""Edomex"" from Estado de México in Spanish. It is located in South-Central Mexico. It is bordered by the states of Querétaro and Hidalgo to the north, Morelos and Guerrero to the south, Michoacán to the west, Tlaxcala and Puebla to the east, and surrounds the Federal District. The state’s origins are in the territory of the Aztec Empire, which remained a political division of the New Spain during the Spanish colonial period. After Independence, Mexico City was chosen as the capital of the new nation; its territory was separated out of the state. Years later, parts of the state were broken off to form the states of Hidalgo, Guerrero and Morelos. These territorial separations have left the state with the size and shape it has today, with the Toluca Valley to the west of Mexico City and a panhandle that extends around the north and east of this entity.

"Syria (/ˈsɪ.rɪə/; Arabic: سوريا or سورية, Sūriyā or Sūrīyah), officially the Syrian Arab Republic, is a country in Western Asia. De jure Syrian territory borders Lebanon and the Mediterranean Sea to the west, Turkey to the north, Iraq to the east, Jordan to the south, and Israel to the southwest, but the government's control now extends to approximately 30–40% of the de jure state area and less than 60% of the population. A country of fertile plains, high mountains, and deserts, Syria is home to diverse ethnic and religious groups, including Syrian Arabs, Greeks, Armenians, Assyrians, Kurds, Circassians, Mandeans and Turks. Religious groups include Sunnis, Christians, Alawites, Druze, Mandeans, Shiites, Salafis, and Yazidis. Sunni Arabs make up the largest population group in Syria. In English, the name ""Syria"" was formerly synonymous with the Levant (known in Arabic as al-Sham), while the modern state encompasses the sites of several ancient kingdoms and empires, including the Eblan civilization of the 3rd millennium BC. Its capital Damascus is among the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. In the Islamic era, Damascus was the seat of the Umayyad Caliphate and a provincial capital of the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt. The modern Syrian state was established after the end of centuries of Ottoman control in World War I as a French mandate, and represented the largest Arab state to emerge from the formerly Ottoman-ruled Arab Levant. It gained independence as a parliamentary republic on 24 October 1945 when Syria became a founding member of the United Nations, an act which legally ended the former French Mandate – although French troops did not leave the country until April 1946. The post-independence period was tumultuous, and a large number of military coups and coup attempts shook the country in the period 1949–71. In 1958, Syria entered a brief union with Egypt called the United Arab Republic, which was terminated by the 1961 Syrian coup d'état. The Arab Republic of Syria came into being in late 1961 after December 1 constitutional referendum, and was increasingly unstable until the Ba'athist coup d'état, since which the Ba'ath Party has maintained its power. Syria was under Emergency Law from 1963 to 2011, effectively suspending most constitutional protections for citizens, and its system of government is considered to be non-democratic by American NGO Freedom House Bashar al-Assad has been president since 2000 and was preceded by his father Hafez al-Assad, who was in office from 1970 to 2000. Syria is a member of one international organization other than the United Nations, the Non-Aligned Movement; it is currently suspended from the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, and self-suspended from the Union for the Mediterranean. Since March 2011, Syria has been embroiled in an uprising against Assad and the Ba'athist government as part of the Arab Spring, a crackdown that contributed to the Syrian Civil War and to Syria's becoming one of the least peaceful countries in the world. The Syrian Interim Government was formed by the opposition umbrella group, the Syrian National Coalition, in March 2013.

The route ends in Kirkenes close to the Russian border. Its length is 3,140 km (1,950 mi). This road was called E 6 in the old ""E"" road system before 1985 and previously continued to Rome. It was given the number E 47 (but not signposted) in the new system on most of the Scandinavian part (Helsingborg–Olderfjord), and E 6 only for the northernmost 460 km (290 mi) (from Olderfjord in Finnmark). After a political negotiation all of the Scandinavian part was given the number E 6 also in the new system which was introduced in Scandinavia 1992. From south to north, E 6 follows the route Trelleborg, Malmö, Helsingborg, Halmstad, Gothenburg, Svinesund in Sweden, then crossing the border into Norway, where the road goes through Halden, Sarpsborg, Moss, Oslo, Gardermoen, Hamar, Lillehammer, Dombås, Oppdal, Melhus, Trondheim, Stjørdal, Verdal, Steinkjer, Grong, Mosjøen, Mo i Rana, Saltdal, Fauske, then further up to Hamarøy with a ferry from Bognes to Skarberget then on via Narvik, Setermoen, Nordkjosbotn, Skibotn, Alta, Olderfjord, Lakselv, Karasjok, Varangerbotn, and Kirkenes, where the road terminates just east of the town center. The road E 6 is a 2+2 lane motorway from outside Trelleborg to Kolomoen south of Hamar, about 690 km. The Swedish E6 motorway and the Norwegian motorway up to Kolomoen were completed in 2015. This motorway is also connected to central Europe by uninterrupted motorway (via E20). Some stretches further north also have four lanes or motorway standard. The rest of the road is ordinary road, usually 6–10 m wide. Some parts in the north of Norway are less than 6 m (20 ft) wide, making it very tight when heavy vehicles meet. It is also often very curvy, at least on the northern half, north of Trondheim.The road E 6 passes over treeless mountain passes in a few places in Norway. In the winter the weather conditions often can be so rough there (snow storm) that the road must be closed temporarily. Between Trelleborg and Kirkenes, there is a more than 800 km (500 mi) shorter route using E4 and E75, among the longest detour any European route has.
